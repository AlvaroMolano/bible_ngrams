02012029,2,12,29,"It happened at midnight, that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle."
02012030,2,12,30,"Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead."
02012031,2,12,31,"He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, ""Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!"
02012032,2,12,32,"Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!"""
02012033,2,12,33,"The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, ""We are all dead men."""
02012034,2,12,34,"The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders."
02012035,2,12,35,"The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing."
02012036,2,12,36,"Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. They despoiled the Egyptians."
02012037,2,12,37,"The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children."
02012038,2,12,38,"A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much cattle."
02012039,2,12,39,"They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they prepared for themselves any food."
02012040,2,12,40,Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.
02012041,2,12,41,"It happened at the end of four hundred thirty years, even the same day it happened, that all the hosts of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt."
02012042,2,12,42,"It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Yahweh, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations."
02012043,2,12,43,"Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, ""This is the ordinance of the Passover. There shall no foreigner eat of it,"
02012044,2,12,44,"but every man's servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it."
02012045,2,12,45,A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.
02012046,2,12,46,In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall you break a bone of it.
02012047,2,12,47,All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
02012048,2,12,48,"When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it."
02012049,2,12,49,"One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you."""
02012050,2,12,50,"Thus did all the children of Israel. As Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did."
02012051,2,12,51,"It happened the same day, that Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts."
02013001,2,13,1,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
02013002,2,13,2,"""Sanctify to me all of the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal. It is mine."""
02013003,2,13,3,"Moses said to the people, ""Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten."

02013006,2,13,6,"Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh."
02013007,2,13,7,"Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall there be yeast seen with you, in all your borders."
02013008,2,13,8,"You shall tell your son in that day, saying, 'It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.'"
02013009,2,13,9,"It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt."
02013010,2,13,10,You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
02013011,2,13,11,"""It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,"
02013012,2,13,12,"that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal. The males shall be Yahweh's."
02013013,2,13,13,"Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons."
02013014,2,13,14,"It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' that you shall tell him, 'By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage;"
02013015,2,13,15,"and it happened, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of animal. Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.'"
02013016,2,13,16,"It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes: for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt."""
02013017,2,13,17,"It happened, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God didn't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, ""Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt;"""
02013018,2,13,18,but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.

02013022,2,13,22,"the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn't depart from before the people."

02014004,2,14,4,"I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh."" They did so."
02014005,2,14,5,"It was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, ""What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"""
02014006,2,14,6,"He made ready his chariot, and took his army with him;"
02014007,2,14,7,"and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them."
02014008,2,14,8,"Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand."
02014009,2,14,9,"The Egyptians pursued after them: all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army; and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon."
02014010,2,14,10,"When Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to Yahweh."
02014011,2,14,11,"They said to Moses, ""Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us forth out of Egypt?"
02014012,2,14,12,"Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?' For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness."""
02014013,2,14,13,"Moses said to the people, ""Don't be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will work for you today: for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never see them again."
02014014,2,14,14,"Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be still."""
02014015,2,14,15,"Yahweh said to Moses, ""Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward."

02014019,2,14,19,"The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them."
02014020,2,14,20,"It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one didn't come near the other all the night."
02014021,2,14,21,"Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided."
02014022,2,14,22,"The children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left."
02014023,2,14,23,"The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea: all of Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen."
02014024,2,14,24,"It happened in the morning watch, that Yahweh looked out on the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army."
02014025,2,14,25,"He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, ""Let's flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!"""
02014026,2,14,26,"Yahweh said to Moses, ""Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen."""
02014027,2,14,27,"Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea."
02014028,2,14,28,"The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh's army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them."
02014029,2,14,29,"But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left."
02014030,2,14,30,Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
02014031,2,14,31,"Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh, and in his servant Moses."
02015001,2,15,1,"Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh, and said, ""I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea."
02015002,2,15,2,"Yah is my strength and song, He has become my salvation: This is my God, and I will praise him; My father's God, and I will exalt him."
02015003,2,15,3,Yahweh is a man of war. Yahweh is his name.
02015004,2,15,4,Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea; His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.
02015005,2,15,5,The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone.
02015006,2,15,6,"Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power, Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces."
02015007,2,15,7,"In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you: You send forth your wrath. It consumes them as stubble."
02015008,2,15,8,With the blast of your nostrils the waters were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
02015009,2,15,9,"The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil. My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'"
02015010,2,15,10,You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
02015011,2,15,11,"Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?"
02015012,2,15,12,You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.
02015013,2,15,13,"""You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation."
02015014,2,15,14,The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
02015015,2,15,15,Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.
02015016,2,15,16,"Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone; Until your people pass over, Yahweh, Until the people pass over who you have purchased."
02015017,2,15,17,"You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, The place, Yahweh, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; The sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have established."
02015018,2,15,18,"Yahweh shall reign forever and ever."""
02015019,2,15,19,"For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea."
02015020,2,15,20,"Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances."

02015024,2,15,24,"The people murmured against Moses, saying, ""What shall we drink?"""
02015025,2,15,25,"Then he cried to Yahweh. Yahweh shown him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them;"
02015026,2,15,26,"and he said, ""If you will diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you."""
02015027,2,15,27,"They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters."

02016002,2,16,2,The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;
02016003,2,16,3,"and the children of Israel said to them, ""We wish that we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger."""
02016004,2,16,4,"Then said Yahweh to Moses, ""Behold, I will rain bread from the sky for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law, or not."

02016006,2,16,6,"Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, ""At evening, then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt;"

02016008,2,16,8,"Moses said, ""Now Yahweh shall give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you; because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh."""
02016009,2,16,9,"Moses said to Aaron, ""Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, 'Come near before Yahweh, for he has heard your murmurings.'"""
02016010,2,16,10,"It happened, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud."
02016011,2,16,11,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
02016012,2,16,12,"""I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, 'At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread: and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God.'"""
02016013,2,16,13,It happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.
02016014,2,16,14,"When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the hoar-frost on the ground."
02016015,2,16,15,"When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, ""What is it?"" For they didn't know what it was. Moses said to them, ""It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat."""
02016016,2,16,16,"This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded: ""Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall you take it, every man for those who are in his tent."""
02016017,2,16,17,"The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less."
02016018,2,16,18,"When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered every man according to his eating."
02016019,2,16,19,"Moses said to them, ""Let no one leave of it until the morning."""
02016020,2,16,20,"Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them."
02016021,2,16,21,"They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted."
02016022,2,16,22,"It happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses."
02016023,2,16,23,"He said to them, ""This is that which Yahweh has spoken, 'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning."""
02016024,2,16,24,"They laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it didn't become foul, neither was there any worm in it."
02016025,2,16,25,"Moses said, ""Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in the field."
02016026,2,16,26,"Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none."""
02016027,2,16,27,"It happened on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none."
02016028,2,16,28,"Yahweh said to Moses, ""How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?"
02016029,2,16,29,"Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day."""
02016030,2,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
02016031,2,16,31,"The house of Israel called the name of it Manna,{""Mana"" means ""What is it?""} and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey."
02016032,2,16,32,"Moses said, ""This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, 'Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt."""

02016034,2,16,34,"As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept."
02016035,2,16,35,"The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan."
02016036,2,16,36,Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
02017001,2,17,1,"All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to Yahweh's commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink."
02017002,2,17,2,"Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, ""Give us water to drink."" Moses said to them, ""Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?"""
02017003,2,17,3,"The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, ""Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"""
02017004,2,17,4,"Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, ""What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."""
02017005,2,17,5,"Yahweh said to Moses, ""Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go."
02017006,2,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink."" Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
02017007,2,17,7,"He called the name of the place Massah,{Massah means testing.} and Meribah,{Meribah means quarreling.} because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying, ""Is Yahweh among us, or not?"""
02017008,2,17,8,Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
02017009,2,17,9,"Moses said to Joshua, ""Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God's rod in my hand."""
02017010,2,17,10,"So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
02017011,2,17,11,"It happened, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
02017012,2,17,12,"But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset."

02038022,2,38,22,"Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Yahweh commanded Moses."
02038023,2,38,23,"With him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen."

02039015,2,39,15,"They made on the breastplate chains like cords, of braided work of pure gold."
02039016,2,39,16,"They made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate."
02039017,2,39,17,They put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.

02039019,2,39,19,"They made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge of it, which was toward the side of the ephod inward."
02039020,2,39,20,"They made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the front of it, close by its coupling, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod."
02039021,2,39,21,"They bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not come loose from the ephod, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02039022,2,39,22,"He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue."
02039023,2,39,23,"The opening of the robe in the midst of it was like the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding around its opening, that it should not be torn."
02039024,2,39,24,"They made on the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet, and twined linen."
02039025,2,39,25,"They made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates around the skirts of the robe, between the pomegranates;"
02039026,2,39,26,"a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the skirts of the robe, to minister in, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02039027,2,39,27,"They made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,"
02039028,2,39,28,"and the turban of fine linen, and the linen headbands of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,"
02039029,2,39,29,"and the sash of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02039030,2,39,30,"They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it a writing, like the engravings of a signet: ""HOLY TO YAHWEH."""
02039031,2,39,31,"They tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02039032,2,39,32,Thus all the work of the tent of the tent of meeting was finished. The children of Israel did according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses; so they did.
02039033,2,39,33,"They brought the tent to Moses, the tent, with all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, it bars, its pillars, its sockets,"
02039034,2,39,34,"the covering of rams' skins dyed red, the covering of sea cow hides, the veil of the screen,"

02039036,2,39,36,"the table, all its vessels, the show bread,"
02039037,2,39,37,"the pure lampstand, its lamps, even the lamps to be set in order, all its vessels, the oil for the light,"

02039041,2,39,41,"the finely worked garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office."
02039042,2,39,42,"According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work."
02039043,2,39,43,"Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it as Yahweh had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them."
02040001,2,40,1,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
02040002,2,40,2,"""On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tent of the Tent of Meeting."
02040003,2,40,3,"You shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and you shall screen the ark with the veil."
02040004,2,40,4,"You shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are on it. You shall bring in the lampstand, and light the lamps of it."
02040005,2,40,5,"You shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tent."
02040006,2,40,6,You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tent of the tent of meeting.
02040007,2,40,7,"You shall set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein."
02040008,2,40,8,"You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court."
02040009,2,40,9,"You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tent, and all that is in it, and shall make it holy, and all its furniture: and it will be holy."
02040010,2,40,10,"You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar will be most holy."
02040011,2,40,11,"You shall anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it."
02040012,2,40,12,"You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water."
02040013,2,40,13,"You shall put on Aaron the holy garments; and you shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office."
02040014,2,40,14,"You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them."
02040015,2,40,15,"You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office. Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations."
02040016,2,40,16,"Thus did Moses: according to all that Yahweh commanded him, so he did."
02040017,2,40,17,"It happened in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tent was raised up."
02040018,2,40,18,"Moses raised up the tent, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards of it, and put in the bars of it, and raised up its pillars."
02040019,2,40,19,"He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tent above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02040020,2,40,20,"He took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark."
02040021,2,40,21,"He brought the ark into the tent, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02040022,2,40,22,"He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the side of the tent northward, outside of the veil."
02040023,2,40,23,"He set the bread in order on it before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02040024,2,40,24,"He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tent southward."
02040025,2,40,25,"He lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02040026,2,40,26,He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil;
02040027,2,40,27,"and he burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02040028,2,40,28,He put up the screen of the door to the tent.
02040029,2,40,29,"He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tent of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal-offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02040030,2,40,30,"He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash."
02040031,2,40,31,"Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there."
02040032,2,40,32,"When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
02040033,2,40,33,"He raised up the court around the tent and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work."
02040034,2,40,34,"Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tent."
02040035,2,40,35,"Moses wasn't able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh's glory filled the tent."
02040036,2,40,36,"When the cloud was taken up from over the tent, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys;"
02040037,2,40,37,"but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel until the day that it was taken up."
02040038,2,40,38,"For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tent by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys."
