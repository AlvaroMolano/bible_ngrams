64001001,64,1,1,"The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth."
64001002,64,1,2,"Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth."
64001003,64,1,3,"For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth."
64001004,64,1,4,"Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth."
64001005,64,1,5,"Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;"
64001006,64,1,6,who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:
64001007,64,1,7,"because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles."
64001008,64,1,8,"We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth."
64001009,64,1,9,"I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not."
64001010,64,1,10,"Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth 'them' out of the church."
64001011,64,1,11,"Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God."
64001012,64,1,12,"Demetrius hath the witness of all 'men', and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest that our witness is true."
64001013,64,1,13,"I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write 'them' to thee with ink and pen:"
64001014,64,1,14,"but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace 'be' unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name."
