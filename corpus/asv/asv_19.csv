19001001,19,1,1,"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:"
19001002,19,1,2,But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night.
19001003,19,1,3,"And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."
19001004,19,1,4,"The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away."
19001005,19,1,5,"Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous."
19001006,19,1,6,For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.
19002001,19,2,1,"Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?"
19002002,19,2,2,"The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, `saying',"
19002003,19,2,3,"Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us."
19002004,19,2,4,He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision.
19002005,19,2,5,"Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure:"

19003004,19,3,4,"I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah"
19003005,19,3,5,I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me.
19003006,19,3,6,I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.
19003007,19,3,7,"Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked."

19005003,19,5,3,"O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; In the morning will I order `my prayer' unto thee, and will keep watch."
19005004,19,5,4,For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: Evil shall not sojourn with thee.
19005005,19,5,5,The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
19005006,19,5,6,Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.
19005007,19,5,7,"But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple."
19005008,19,5,8,"Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face."
19005009,19,5,9,For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue.
19005010,19,5,10,"Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee."
19005011,19,5,11,"But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee."

19006004,19,6,4,"Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me for thy lovingkindness' sake."
19006005,19,6,5,For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?
19006006,19,6,6,I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
19006007,19,6,7,Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.
19006008,19,6,8,"Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping."

19008003,19,8,3,"When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;"
19008004,19,8,4,"What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?"
19008005,19,8,5,"For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor."
19008006,19,8,6,Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:
19008007,19,8,7,"All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field,"

19009003,19,9,3,"When mine enemies turn back, They stumble and perish at thy presence."
19009004,19,9,4,For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously.
19009005,19,9,5,"Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever."
19009006,19,9,6,"The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; And the cities which thou hast overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished."
19009007,19,9,7,But Jehovah sitteth `as king' for ever: He hath prepared his throne for judgment;
19009008,19,9,8,"And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness."

19009013,19,9,13,"Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; Behold my affliction `which I suffer' of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;"

19010001,19,10,1,"Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?"
19010002,19,10,2,In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.
19010003,19,10,3,"For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, And the covetous renounceth, `yea', contemneth Jehovah."
19010004,19,10,4,"The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, `saith', He will not require `it'. All his thoughts are, There is no God."
19010005,19,10,5,"His ways are firm at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them."
19010006,19,10,6,"He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; To all generations I shall not be in adversity."
19010007,19,10,7,His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
19010008,19,10,8,He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are privily set against the helpless.
19010009,19,10,9,"He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert; He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net."
19010010,19,10,10,"He croucheth, he boweth down, And the helpless fall by his strong ones."
19010011,19,10,11,"He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten; He hideth his face; he will never see it."
19010012,19,10,12,"Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thy hand: Forget not the poor."
19010013,19,10,13,"Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require `it'?"
19010014,19,10,14,"Thou hast seen `it'; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: The helpless committeth `himself' unto thee; Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless."
19010015,19,10,15,"Break thou the arm of the wicked; And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none."
19010016,19,10,16,Jehovah is King for ever and ever: The nations are perished out of his land.
19010017,19,10,17,"Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear;"

19011003,19,11,3,"If the foundations be destroyed, What can the righteous do?"
19011004,19,11,4,"Jehovah is in his holy temple; Jehovah, his throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men."
19011005,19,11,5,Jehovah trieth the righteous; But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
19011006,19,11,6,Upon the wicked he will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.

19013002,19,13,2,"How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?"
19013003,19,13,3,"Consider `and' answer me, O Jehovah my God: Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the `sleep of' death;"
19013004,19,13,4,"Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; `Lest' mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved."

19014003,19,14,3,"They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one."
19014004,19,14,4,"Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people `as' they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah?"
19014005,19,14,5,There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous.
19014006,19,14,6,"Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge."

19017009,19,17,9,"From the wicked that oppress me, My deadly enemies, that compass me about."
19017010,19,17,10,They are inclosed in their own fat: With their mouth they speak proudly.
19017011,19,17,11,They have now compassed us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast `us' down to the earth.

19018003,19,18,3,"I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies."
19018004,19,18,4,"The cords of death compassed me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid."
19018005,19,18,5,The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.
19018006,19,18,6,"In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry before him came into his ears."
19018007,19,18,7,"Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations also of the mountains quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth."
19018008,19,18,8,"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it."
19018009,19,18,9,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet."
19018010,19,18,10,"And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind."
19018011,19,18,11,"He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies."
19018012,19,18,12,"At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire."
19018013,19,18,13,"Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire."
19018014,19,18,14,"And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them."
19018015,19,18,15,"Then the channels of waters appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At thy rebuke, O Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils."
19018016,19,18,16,"He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters."
19018017,19,18,17,"He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me."
19018018,19,18,18,They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.
19018019,19,18,19,"He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me."
19018020,19,18,20,Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
19018021,19,18,21,"For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God."
19018022,19,18,22,"For all his ordinances were before me, And I put not away his statutes from me."
19018023,19,18,23,"I was also perfect with him, And I kept myself from mine iniquity."
19018024,19,18,24,"Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight."
19018025,19,18,25,With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;
19018026,19,18,26,With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.
19018027,19,18,27,For thou wilt save the afflicted people; But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down.
19018028,19,18,28,For thou wilt light my lamp: Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness.
19018029,19,18,29,For by thee I run upon a troop; And by my God do I leap over a wall.
19018030,19,18,30,"As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him."
19018031,19,18,31,"For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, besides our God,"
19018032,19,18,32,"The God that girdeth me with strength, And maketh my way perfect?"
19018033,19,18,33,He maketh my feet like hinds' `feet': And setteth me upon my high places.
19018034,19,18,34,He teacheth my hands to war; So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
19018035,19,18,35,"Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy right hand hath holden me up, And thy gentleness hath made me great."
19018036,19,18,36,"Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped."
19018037,19,18,37,"I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; Neither will I turn again till they are consumed."
19018038,19,18,38,"I will smite them through, so that they shall not be able to rise: They shall fall under my feet."
19018039,19,18,39,For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
19018040,19,18,40,"Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me."
19018041,19,18,41,"They cried, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not."
19018042,19,18,42,Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.
19018043,19,18,43,Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
19018044,19,18,44,As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me; The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me.
19018045,19,18,45,"The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places."
19018046,19,18,46,"Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation,"
19018047,19,18,47,"Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And subdueth peoples under me."
19018048,19,18,48,"He rescueth me from mine enemies; Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man."
19018049,19,18,49,"Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name."
19018050,19,18,50,"Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore. Psalm 19 For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David."
19019001,19,19,1,The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament showeth his handiwork.
19019002,19,19,2,"Day unto day uttereth speech, And night unto night showeth knowledge."
19019003,19,19,3,There is no speech nor language; Their voice is not heard.
19019004,19,19,4,"Their line is gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,"
19019005,19,19,5,"Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course."
19019006,19,19,6,"His going forth is from the end of the heavens, And his circuit unto the ends of it; And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof."
19019007,19,19,7,"The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul: The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple."
19019008,19,19,8,"The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart: The commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes."
19019009,19,19,9,"The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever: The ordinances of Jehovah are true, `and' righteous altogether."
19019010,19,19,10,"More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb."
19019011,19,19,11,Moreover by them is thy servant warned: In keeping them there is great reward.
19019012,19,19,12,Who can discern `his' errors? Clear thou me from hidden `faults'.
19019013,19,19,13,"Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous `sins'; Let them not have dominion over me: Then shall I be upright, And I shall be clear from great transgression."
19019014,19,19,14,"Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer. Psalm 20 For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David."
19020001,19,20,1,Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high;
19020002,19,20,2,"Send thee help from the sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion;"
19020003,19,20,3,"Remember all thy offerings, And accept thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah"
19020004,19,20,4,"Grant thee thy heart's desire, And fulfil all thy counsel."
19020005,19,20,5,"We will triumph in thy salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners: Jehovah fulfil all thy petitions."
19020006,19,20,6,Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; He will answer him from his holy heaven With the saving strength of his right hand.
19020007,19,20,7,"Some `trust' in chariots, and some in horses; But we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God."
19020008,19,20,8,"They are bowed down and fallen; But we are risen, and stand upright."
19020009,19,20,9,"Save, Jehovah: Let the King answer us when we call. Psalm 21 For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David."
19021001,19,21,1,"The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah; And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!"
19021002,19,21,2,"Thou hast given him his heart's desire, And hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah"
19021003,19,21,3,For thou meetest him with the blessings of goodness: Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.
19021004,19,21,4,"He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him, Even length of days for ever and ever."
19021005,19,21,5,His glory is great in thy salvation: Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him.
19021006,19,21,6,For thou makest him most blessed for ever: Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence.
19021007,19,21,7,For the king trusteth in Jehovah; And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.
19021008,19,21,8,Thy hand will find out all thine enemies; Thy right hand will find out those that hate thee.
19021009,19,21,9,"Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger: Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire shall devour them."
19021010,19,21,10,"Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth, And their seed from among the children of men."
19021011,19,21,11,For they intended evil against thee; They conceived a device which they are not able to perform.
19021012,19,21,12,For thou wilt make them turn their back; Thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face.
19021013,19,21,13,"Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength: So will we sing and praise thy power. Psalm 22 For the Chief Musician; set to Aijaleth hash-Shahar. A Psalm of David."
19022001,19,22,1,"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? `Why art thou so' far from helping me, `and from' the words of my groaning?"
19022002,19,22,2,"O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou answerest not; And in the night season, and am not silent."
19022003,19,22,3,"But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel."
19022004,19,22,4,"Our fathers trusted in thee: They trusted, and thou didst deliver them."
19022005,19,22,5,"They cried unto thee, and were delivered: They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame."
19022006,19,22,6,"But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised of the people."
19022007,19,22,7,"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, `saying',"
19022008,19,22,8,"Commit `thyself' unto Jehovah; Let him deliver him: Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him."
19022009,19,22,9,But thou art he that took me out of the womb; Thou didst make me trust `when I was' upon my mother's breasts.
19022010,19,22,10,I was cast upon thee from the womb; Thou art my God since my mother bare me.
19022011,19,22,11,Be not far from me; for trouble is near; For there is none to help.
19022012,19,22,12,Many bulls have compassed me; Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
19022013,19,22,13,"They gape upon me with their mouth, `As' a ravening and a roaring lion."
19022014,19,22,14,"I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint: My heart is like wax; It is melted within me."
19022015,19,22,15,My strength is dried up like a potsherd; And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; And thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
19022016,19,22,16,For dogs have compassed me: A company of evil-doers have inclosed me; They pierced my hands and my feet.
19022017,19,22,17,I may count all my bones; They look and stare upon me.
19022018,19,22,18,"They part my garments among them, And upon my vesture do they cast lots."
19022019,19,22,19,"But be not thou far off, O Jehovah: O thou my succor, haste thee to help me."
19022020,19,22,20,"Deliver my soul from the sword, My darling from the power of the dog."
19022021,19,22,21,"Save me from the lion's mouth; Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me."
19022022,19,22,22,I will declare thy name unto my brethren: In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee.
19022023,19,22,23,"Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; And stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel."
19022024,19,22,24,"For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Neither hath he hid his face from him; But when he cried unto him, he heard."
19022025,19,22,25,Of thee cometh my praise in the great assembly: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
19022026,19,22,26,The meek shall eat and be satisfied; They shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: Let your heart live for ever.
19022027,19,22,27,All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
19022028,19,22,28,For the kingdom is Jehovah's; And he is the ruler over the nations.
19022029,19,22,29,"All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship: All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, Even he that cannot keep his soul alive."
19022030,19,22,30,A seed shall serve him; It shall be told of the Lord unto the `next' generation.
19022031,19,22,31,"They shall come and shall declare his righteousness Unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it. Psalm 23 A Psalm of David."
19023001,19,23,1,Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want.
19023002,19,23,2,He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters.
19023003,19,23,3,He restoreth my soul: He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
19023004,19,23,4,"Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."
19023005,19,23,5,Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou hast anointed my head with oil; My cup runneth over.
19023006,19,23,6,Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever. Psalm 24 A Psalm of David.
19024001,19,24,1,"The earth is Jehovah's, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein."
19024002,19,24,2,"For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods."
19024003,19,24,3,Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place?
19024004,19,24,4,"He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, And hath not sworn deceitfully."
19024005,19,24,5,"He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah, And righteousness from the God of his salvation."
19024006,19,24,6,"This is the generation of them that seek after him, That seek thy face, `even' Jacob. Selah"
19024007,19,24,7,"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in."
19024008,19,24,8,"Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle."

19025007,19,25,7,"Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: According to thy lovingkindness remember thou me, For thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah."
19025008,19,25,8,Good and upright is Jehovah: Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way.
19025009,19,25,9,The meek will he guide in justice; And the meek will he teach his way.
19025010,19,25,10,All the paths of Jehovah are lovingkindness and truth Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
19025011,19,25,11,"For thy name's sake, O Jehovah, Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great."
19025012,19,25,12,What man is he that feareth Jehovah? Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose.
19025013,19,25,13,His soul shall dwell at ease; And his seed shall inherit the land.
19025014,19,25,14,The friendship of Jehovah is with them that fear him; And he will show them his covenant.

19027001,19,27,1,Jehovah is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?

19027004,19,27,4,"One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after; That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of Jehovah, And to inquire in his temple."
19027005,19,27,5,For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion: In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me; He will lift me up upon a rock.
19027006,19,27,6,"And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah."

19038003,19,38,3,There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation; Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
19038004,19,38,4,For mine iniquities are gone over my head: As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
19038005,19,38,5,"My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, Because of my foolishness."
19038006,19,38,6,I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
19038007,19,38,7,For my loins are filled with burning; And there is no soundness in my flesh.
19038008,19,38,8,I am faint and sore bruised: I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.

19038014,19,38,14,"Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, And in whose mouth are no reproofs."
19038015,19,38,15,"For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope: Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God."
19038016,19,38,16,"For I said, Lest they rejoice over me: When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me."
19038017,19,38,17,"For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me."
19038018,19,38,18,For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

19039002,19,39,2,"I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow was stirred."
19039003,19,39,3,My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned: `Then' spake I with my tongue:
19039004,19,39,4,"Jehovah, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am."
19039005,19,39,5,"Behold, thou hast made my days `as' handbreadths; And my life-time is as nothing before thee: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah"
19039006,19,39,6,"Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heapeth up `riches', and knoweth not who shall gather them."
19039007,19,39,7,"And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee."
19039008,19,39,8,Deliver me from all my transgressions: Make me not the reproach of the foolish.
19039009,19,39,9,"I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; Because thou didst it."
19039010,19,39,10,Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.
19039011,19,39,11,"When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: Surely every man is vanity. Selah"

19040002,19,40,2,"He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay; And he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings."
19040003,19,40,3,"And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: Many shall see it, and fear, And shall trust in Jehovah."
19040004,19,40,4,"Blessed is the man that maketh Jehovah his trust, And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies."
19040005,19,40,5,"Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done, And thy thoughts which are to us-ward; They cannot be set in order unto thee; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered."
19040006,19,40,6,Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; Mine ears hast thou opened: Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required.
19040007,19,40,7,"Then said I, Lo, I am come; In the roll of the book it is written of me:"
19040008,19,40,8,"I delight to do thy will, O my God; Yea, thy law is within my heart."
19040009,19,40,9,"I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly; Lo, I will not refrain my lips, O Jehovah, thou knowest."
19040010,19,40,10,I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great assembly.
19040011,19,40,11,"Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Jehovah; Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me."
19040012,19,40,12,"For innumerable evils have compassed me about; Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head; And my heart hath failed me."
19040013,19,40,13,"Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me: Make haste to help me, O Jehovah."
19040014,19,40,14,Let them be put to shame and confounded together That seek after my soul to destroy it: Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt.
19040015,19,40,15,"Let them be desolate by reason of their shame That say unto me, Aha, aha."
19040016,19,40,16,"Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: Let such as love thy salvation say continually, Jehovah be magnified."

19050005,19,50,5,"Gather my saints together unto me, Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."
19050006,19,50,6,And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; For God is judge himself. Selah
19050007,19,50,7,"Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify unto thee: I am God, `even' thy God."
19050008,19,50,8,I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; And thy burnt-offerings are continually before me.
19050009,19,50,9,"I will take no bullock out of thy house, Nor he-goats out of thy folds."

19051002,19,51,2,"Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin."

19051015,19,51,15,"O Lord, open thou my lips; And my mouth shall show forth thy praise."
19051016,19,51,16,For thou delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it: Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.
19051017,19,51,17,"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: A broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise."

19054004,19,54,4,"Behold, God is my helper: The Lord is of them that uphold my soul."
19054005,19,54,5,He will requite the evil unto mine enemies: Destroy thou them in thy truth.

19055001,19,55,1,"Give ear to my prayer, O God; And hide not thyself from my supplication."

19055010,19,55,10,Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.
19055011,19,55,11,Wickedness is in the midst thereof: Oppression and guile depart not from its streets.
19055012,19,55,12,For it was not an enemy that reproached me; Then I could have borne it: Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; Then I would have hid myself from him:
19055013,19,55,13,"But it was thou, a man mine equal, My companion, and my familiar friend."
19055014,19,55,14,We took sweet counsel together; We walked in the house of God with the throng.

19055018,19,55,18,He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; For they were many `that strove' with me.
19055019,19,55,19,"God will hear, and answer them, Even he that abideth of old, Selah `The men' who have no changes, And who fear not God."
19055020,19,55,20,He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him: He hath profaned his covenant.
19055021,19,55,21,"His mouth was smooth as butter, But his heart was war: His words were softer than oil, Yet were they drawn swords."

19056007,19,56,7,"Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God."
19056008,19,56,8,Thou numberest my wanderings: Put thou my tears into thy bottle; Are they not in thy book?
19056009,19,56,9,"Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call: This I know, that God is for me."
19056010,19,56,10,"In God (I will praise `his' word), In Jehovah (I will praise `his' word),"
19056011,19,56,11,"In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can man do unto me?"
19056012,19,56,12,"Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render thank-offerings unto thee."

19057003,19,57,3,"He will send from heaven, and save me, `When' he that would swallow me up reproacheth; Selah God will send forth his lovingkindness and his truth."
19057004,19,57,4,"My soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword."
19057005,19,57,5,"Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; `Let' thy glory `be' above all the earth."
19057006,19,57,6,They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me; They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah

19058007,19,58,7,"Let them melt away as water that runneth apace: When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off."
19058008,19,58,8,"`Let them be' as a snail which melteth and passeth away, `Like' the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not seen the sun."

19073011,19,73,11,"And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?"
19073012,19,73,12,"Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches."
19073013,19,73,13,"Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency;"
19073014,19,73,14,"For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning."
19073015,19,73,15,"If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children."
19073016,19,73,16,"When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me;"
19073017,19,73,17,"Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end."
19073018,19,73,18,Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction.
19073019,19,73,19,How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.
19073020,19,73,20,"As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image."
19073021,19,73,21,"For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart:"
19073022,19,73,22,"So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was `as' a beast before thee."
19073023,19,73,23,Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand.
19073024,19,73,24,"Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory."
19073025,19,73,25,Whom have I in heaven `but thee'? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
19073026,19,73,26,My flesh and my heart faileth; `But' God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
19073027,19,73,27,"For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, `departing' from thee."

19074002,19,74,2,"Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old, Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance; `And' mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt."
19074003,19,74,3,"Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins, All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary."
19074004,19,74,4,Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly; They have set up their ensigns for signs.
19074005,19,74,5,They seemed as men that lifted up Axes upon a thicket of trees.
19074006,19,74,6,And now all the carved work thereof They break down with hatchet and hammers.
19074007,19,74,7,They have set thy sanctuary on fire; They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name `by casting it' to the ground.
19074008,19,74,8,"They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land."
19074009,19,74,9,We see not our signs: There is no more any prophet; Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
19074010,19,74,10,"How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?"
19074011,19,74,11,"Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? `Pluck it' out of thy bosom `and' consume `them'."

19074013,19,74,13,Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.
19074014,19,74,14,Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
19074015,19,74,15,Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: Thou driedst up mighty rivers.
19074016,19,74,16,"The day is thine, the night also is thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun."
19074017,19,74,17,Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: Thou hast made summer and winter.
19074018,19,74,18,"Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Jehovah, And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name."
19074019,19,74,19,Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast: Forget not the life of thy poor for ever.
19074020,19,74,20,Have respect unto the covenant; For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
19074021,19,74,21,Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed: Let the poor and needy praise thy name.
19074022,19,74,22,"Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day."

19075005,19,75,5,Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck.
19075006,19,75,6,"For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, `cometh' lifting up."
19075007,19,75,7,"But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another."
19075008,19,75,8,"For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them."

19076007,19,76,7,"Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?"
19076008,19,76,8,"Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,"
19076009,19,76,9,"When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah"
19076010,19,76,10,Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.

19077004,19,77,4,Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
19077005,19,77,5,"I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times."
19077006,19,77,6,I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent search.
19077007,19,77,7,Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more?
19077008,19,77,8,Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?
19077009,19,77,9,Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah

19078008,19,78,8,"And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God."

19078010,19,78,10,"They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;"

19078017,19,78,17,"Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert."
19078018,19,78,18,And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire.
19078019,19,78,19,"Yea, they spake against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?"
19078020,19,78,20,"Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?"
19078021,19,78,21,"Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;"
19078022,19,78,22,"Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation."

19078025,19,78,25,Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.
19078026,19,78,26,He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.
19078027,19,78,27,"He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:"
19078028,19,78,28,"And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations."
19078029,19,78,29,"So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire."

19078031,19,78,31,"When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel."

19078033,19,78,33,"Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror."
19078034,19,78,34,"When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly."
19078035,19,78,35,"And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer."
19078036,19,78,36,"But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue."
19078037,19,78,37,"For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant."
19078038,19,78,38,"But he, being merciful, forgave `their' iniquity, and destroyed `them' not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath."
19078039,19,78,39,"And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again."
19078040,19,78,40,"How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!"
19078041,19,78,41,"And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel."
19078042,19,78,42,"They remember not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;"
19078043,19,78,43,"How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,"
19078044,19,78,44,"And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink."
19078045,19,78,45,"He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them."
19078046,19,78,46,"He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust."
19078047,19,78,47,"He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost."
19078048,19,78,48,"He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts."
19078049,19,78,49,"He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil."
19078050,19,78,50,"He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,"
19078051,19,78,51,"And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham."
19078052,19,78,52,"But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock."
19078053,19,78,53,"And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies."
19078054,19,78,54,"And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten."
19078055,19,78,55,"He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents."
19078056,19,78,56,"Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;"
19078057,19,78,57,"But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow."
19078058,19,78,58,"For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images."
19078059,19,78,59,"When God heard `this', he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;"
19078060,19,78,60,"So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;"
19078061,19,78,61,"And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversary's hand."
19078062,19,78,62,"He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance."
19078063,19,78,63,Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.
19078064,19,78,64,Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.
19078065,19,78,65,"Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine."
19078066,19,78,66,And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach.
19078067,19,78,67,"Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,"
19078068,19,78,68,"But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved."
19078069,19,78,69,"And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever."
19078070,19,78,70,"He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds:"
19078071,19,78,71,"From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance."

19079003,19,79,3,Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them.
19079004,19,79,4,"We are become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us."

19079006,19,79,6,"Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name."
19079007,19,79,7,"For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation."

19080005,19,80,5,"Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure."
19080006,19,80,6,Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.

19080011,19,80,11,"It sent out its branches unto the sea, And its shoots unto the River."
19080012,19,80,12,"Why hast thou broken down its walls, So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?"
19080013,19,80,13,"The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it."

19092002,19,92,2,"To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night,"
19092003,19,92,3,"With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; With a solemn sound upon the harp."
19092004,19,92,4,"For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands."
19092005,19,92,5,"How great are thy works, O Jehovah! Thy thoughts are very deep."
19092006,19,92,6,A brutish man knoweth not; Neither doth a fool understand this:
19092007,19,92,7,"When the wicked spring as the grass, And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; It is that they shall be destroyed for ever."
19092008,19,92,8,"But thou, O Jehovah, art on high for evermore."
19092009,19,92,9,"For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, thine enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered."
19092010,19,92,10,But my horn hast thou exalted like `the horn of' the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil.
19092011,19,92,11,"Mine eye also hath seen `my desire' on mine enemies, Mine ears have heard `my desire' of the evil-doers that rise up against me."
19092012,19,92,12,The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
19092013,19,92,13,They are planted in the house of Jehovah; They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
19092014,19,92,14,They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and green:
19092015,19,92,15,"To show that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him."
19093001,19,93,1,"Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself therewith: The world also is established, that it cannot be moved."
19093002,19,93,2,Thy throne is established of old: Thou art from everlasting.
19093003,19,93,3,"The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves."
19093004,19,93,4,"Above the voices of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea, Jehovah on high is mighty."
19093005,19,93,5,"Thy testimonies are very sure: Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for evermore."
19094001,19,94,1,"O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth."
19094002,19,94,2,"Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: Render to the proud `their' desert."
19094003,19,94,3,"Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked triumph?"
19094004,19,94,4,"They prate, they speak arrogantly: All the workers of iniquity boast themselves."
19094005,19,94,5,"They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, And afflict thy heritage."
19094006,19,94,6,"They slay the widow and the sojourner, And murder the fatherless."
19094007,19,94,7,"And they say, Jehovah will not see, Neither will the God of Jacob consider."
19094008,19,94,8,"Consider, ye brutish among the people; And ye fools, when will ye be wise?"
19094009,19,94,9,"He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?"
19094010,19,94,10,"He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct, `Even' he that teacheth man knowledge?"
19094011,19,94,11,"Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man, That they are vanity."
19094012,19,94,12,"Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah, And teachest out of thy law;"
19094013,19,94,13,"That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit be digged for the wicked."
19094014,19,94,14,"For Jehovah will not cast off his people, Neither will he forsake his inheritance."
19094015,19,94,15,For judgment shall return unto righteousness; And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
19094016,19,94,16,Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
19094017,19,94,17,"Unless Jehovah had been my help, My soul had soon dwelt in silence."
19094018,19,94,18,"When I said, My foot slippeth; Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up."
19094019,19,94,19,In the multitude of my thoughts within me Thy comforts delight my soul.
19094020,19,94,20,"Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, Which frameth mischief by statute?"
19094021,19,94,21,"They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, And condemn the innocent blood."
19094022,19,94,22,"But Jehovah hath been my high tower, And my God the rock of my refuge."
19094023,19,94,23,"And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, And will cut them off in their own wickedness; Jehovah our God will cut them off."
19095001,19,95,1,"Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation."
19095002,19,95,2,Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
19095003,19,95,3,"For Jehovah is a great God, And a great King above all gods."
19095004,19,95,4,In his hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the mountains are his also.
19095005,19,95,5,"The sea is his, and he made it; And his hands formed the dry land."
19095006,19,95,6,"Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker:"
19095007,19,95,7,"For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice!"
19095008,19,95,8,"Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;"
19095009,19,95,9,"When your fathers tempted me, Proved me, and saw my work."
19095010,19,95,10,"Forty years long was I grieved with `that' generation, And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, And they have not known my ways:"
19095011,19,95,11,"Wherefore I sware in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest."
19096001,19,96,1,"Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song: Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth."
19096002,19,96,2,"Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; Show forth his salvation from day to day."
19096003,19,96,3,"Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples."
19096004,19,96,4,"For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all gods."
19096005,19,96,5,For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.
19096006,19,96,6,Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
19096007,19,96,7,"Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength."
19096008,19,96,8,"Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come into his courts."
19096009,19,96,9,"Oh worship Jehovah in holy array: Tremble before him, all the earth."
19096010,19,96,10,"Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved: He will judge the peoples with equity."
19096011,19,96,11,"Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;"
19096012,19,96,12,"Let the field exult, and all that is therein; Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy"
19096013,19,96,13,"Before Jehovah; for he cometh, For he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with his truth."
19097001,19,97,1,Jehovah reigneth; let the earth rejoice; Let the multitude of isles be glad.
19097002,19,97,2,Clouds and darkness are round about him: Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
19097003,19,97,3,"A fire goeth before him, And burneth up his adversaries round about."
19097004,19,97,4,"His lightnings lightened the world: The earth saw, and trembled."

19098002,19,98,2,Jehovah hath made known his salvation: His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations.
19098003,19,98,3,He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
19098004,19,98,4,"Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all the earth: Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises."
19098005,19,98,5,Sing praises unto Jehovah with the harp; With the harp and the voice of melody.
19098006,19,98,6,"With trumpets and sound of cornet Make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah."
19098007,19,98,7,"Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein;"
19098008,19,98,8,Let the floods clap their hands; Let the hills sing for joy together
19098009,19,98,9,"Before Jehovah; for he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with equity."
19099001,19,99,1,Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble: He sitteth `above' the cherubim; let the earth be moved.
19099002,19,99,2,Jehovah is great in Zion; And he is high above all the peoples.
19099003,19,99,3,Let them praise thy great and terrible name: Holy is he.
19099004,19,99,4,The king's strength also loveth justice; Thou dost establish equity; Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob.
19099005,19,99,5,"Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his footstool: Holy is he."
19099006,19,99,6,"Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them."
19099007,19,99,7,"He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them."
19099008,19,99,8,"Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God: Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings."

19101001,19,101,1,"I will sing of lovingkindness and justice: Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I sing praises."
19101002,19,101,2,I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: Oh when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
19101003,19,101,3,I will set no base thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; It shall not cleave unto me.
19101004,19,101,4,A perverse heart shall depart from me: I will know no evil thing.
19101005,19,101,5,"Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy: Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer."

19101007,19,101,7,He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.
19101008,19,101,8,"Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah. Psalm 102 A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before Jehovah."
19102001,19,102,1,"Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And let my cry come unto thee."
19102002,19,102,2,Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: Incline thine ear unto me; In the day when I call answer me speedily.
19102003,19,102,3,"For my days consume away like smoke, And my bones are burned as a firebrand."
19102004,19,102,4,"My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; For I forget to eat my bread."
19102005,19,102,5,By reason of the voice of my groaning My bones cleave to my flesh.
19102006,19,102,6,I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.
19102007,19,102,7,"I watch, and am become like a sparrow That is alone upon the house-top."
19102008,19,102,8,Mine enemies reproach me all the day; They that are mad against me do curse by me.
19102009,19,102,9,"For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping,"
19102010,19,102,10,"Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away."
19102011,19,102,11,My days are like a shadow that declineth; And I am withered like grass.

19102014,19,102,14,"For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, And have pity upon her dust."
19102015,19,102,15,"So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory."
19102016,19,102,16,For Jehovah hath built up Zion; He hath appeared in his glory.
19102017,19,102,17,"He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, And hath not despised their prayer."
19102018,19,102,18,This shall be written for the generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah.
19102019,19,102,19,For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth;
19102020,19,102,20,To hear the sighing of the prisoner; To loose those that are appointed to death;
19102021,19,102,21,"That men may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem;"
19102022,19,102,22,"When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah."
19102023,19,102,23,He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.
19102024,19,102,24,"I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: Thy years are throughout all generations."
19102025,19,102,25,Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the work of thy hands.
19102026,19,102,26,"They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:"
19102027,19,102,27,"But thou art the same, And thy years shall have no end."
19102028,19,102,28,"The children of thy servants shall continue, And their seed shall be established before thee. Psalm 103 `A Psalm' of David."
19103001,19,103,1,"Bless Jehovah, O my soul; And all that is within me, `bless' his holy name."
19103002,19,103,2,"Bless Jehovah, O my soul, And forget not all his benefits:"
19103003,19,103,3,Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases;
19103004,19,103,4,Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
19103005,19,103,5,"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, `So that' thy youth is renewed like the eagle."
19103006,19,103,6,"Jehovah executeth righteous acts, And judgments for all that are oppressed."
19103007,19,103,7,"He made known his ways unto Moses, His doings unto the children of Israel."
19103008,19,103,8,"Jehovah is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness."
19103009,19,103,9,He will not always chide; Neither will he keep `his anger' for ever.
19103010,19,103,10,"He hath not dealt with us after our sins, Nor rewarded us after our iniquities."
19103011,19,103,11,"For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him."
19103012,19,103,12,"As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us."
19103013,19,103,13,"Like as a father pitieth his children, So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him."
19103014,19,103,14,For he knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust.
19103015,19,103,15,"As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth."
19103016,19,103,16,"For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more."
19103017,19,103,17,"But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his righteousness unto children's children;"
19103018,19,103,18,"To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them."
19103019,19,103,19,Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens; And his kingdom ruleth over all.
19103020,19,103,20,"Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, That are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word, Hearkening unto the voice of his word."
19103021,19,103,21,"Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure."
19103022,19,103,22,"Bless Jehovah, all ye his works, In all places of his dominion: Bless Jehovah, O my soul."
19104001,19,104,1,"Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:"
19104002,19,104,2,Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;
19104003,19,104,3,Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;
19104004,19,104,4,Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers;
19104005,19,104,5,"Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever."
19104006,19,104,6,Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains.
19104007,19,104,7,At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
19104008,19,104,8,"(The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them."
19104009,19,104,9,Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth.
19104010,19,104,10,He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains;
19104011,19,104,11,They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild asses quench their thirst.
19104012,19,104,12,By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; They sing among the branches.
19104013,19,104,13,He watereth the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
19104014,19,104,14,"He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth,"
19104015,19,104,15,"And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, `And' oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth man's heart."
19104016,19,104,16,"The trees of Jehovah are filled `with moisture', The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;"
19104017,19,104,17,"Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house."
19104018,19,104,18,The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
19104019,19,104,19,He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down.
19104020,19,104,20,"Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth."
19104021,19,104,21,"The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God."
19104022,19,104,22,"The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens."
19104023,19,104,23,Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labor until the evening.
19104024,19,104,24,"O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches."
19104025,19,104,25,"Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts."
19104026,19,104,26,"There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein."
19104027,19,104,27,"These wait all for thee, That thou mayest give them their food in due season."
19104028,19,104,28,"Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good."
19104029,19,104,29,"Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust."
19104030,19,104,30,"Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground."
19104031,19,104,31,Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works:
19104032,19,104,32,"Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke."
19104033,19,104,33,I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
19104034,19,104,34,Let thy meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in Jehovah.
19104035,19,104,35,"Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah."
19105001,19,105,1,"Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known among the peoples his doings."
19105002,19,105,2,"Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvelous works."
19105003,19,105,3,Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.
19105004,19,105,4,Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.
19105005,19,105,5,"Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,"
19105006,19,105,6,"O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones."
19105007,19,105,7,He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth.
19105008,19,105,8,"He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,"
19105009,19,105,9,"`The covenant' which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,"
19105010,19,105,10,"And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,"
19105011,19,105,11,"Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;"
19105012,19,105,12,"When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it."
19105013,19,105,13,"And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people."
19105014,19,105,14,"He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,"
19105015,19,105,15,"`Saying', Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm."
19105016,19,105,16,And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.
19105017,19,105,17,He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant:
19105018,19,105,18,"His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in `chains of' iron,"
19105019,19,105,19,"Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him."
19105020,19,105,20,"The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free."
19105021,19,105,21,"He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;"
19105022,19,105,22,"To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom."
19105023,19,105,23,Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
19105024,19,105,24,"And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries."
19105025,19,105,25,"He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants."
19105026,19,105,26,"He sent Moses his servant, `And' Aaron whom he had chosen."
19105027,19,105,27,"They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham."
19105028,19,105,28,"He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words."
19105029,19,105,29,"He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish."
19105030,19,105,30,Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.
19105031,19,105,31,"He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders."
19105032,19,105,32,"He gave them hail for rain, `And' flaming fire in their land."
19105033,19,105,33,"He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders."
19105034,19,105,34,"He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,"
19105035,19,105,35,"And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground."
19105036,19,105,36,"He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength."
19105037,19,105,37,And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.
19105038,19,105,38,Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
19105039,19,105,39,"He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night."
19105040,19,105,40,"They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven."
19105041,19,105,41,"He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places `like' a river."
19105042,19,105,42,"For he remembered his holy word, `And' Abraham his servant."
19105043,19,105,43,"And he brought forth his people with joy, `And' his chosen with singing."
19105044,19,105,44,And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:
19105045,19,105,45,"That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah."
19106001,19,106,1,Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness `endureth' forever.
19106002,19,106,2,"Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?"
19106003,19,106,3,"Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times."
19106004,19,106,4,"Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,"
19106005,19,106,5,"That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance."
19106006,19,106,6,"We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly."
19106007,19,106,7,"Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea."
19106008,19,106,8,"Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known."
19106009,19,106,9,"He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness."
19106010,19,106,10,"And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy."
19106011,19,106,11,And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.
19106012,19,106,12,Then believed they his words; They sang his praise.
19106013,19,106,13,"They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,"
19106014,19,106,14,"But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert."
19106015,19,106,15,"And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul."
19106016,19,106,16,"They envied Moses also in the camp, `And' Aaron the saint of Jehovah."
19106017,19,106,17,"The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram."
19106018,19,106,18,And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.
19106019,19,106,19,"They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image."
19106020,19,106,20,Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.
19106021,19,106,21,"They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,"
19106022,19,106,22,"Wondrous works in the land of Ham, `And' terrible things by the Red Sea."
19106023,19,106,23,"Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy `them'."
19106024,19,106,24,"Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,"
19106025,19,106,25,"But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah."
19106026,19,106,26,"Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,"
19106027,19,106,27,"And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands."
19106028,19,106,28,"They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead."
19106029,19,106,29,Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.
19106030,19,106,30,"Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed."
19106031,19,106,31,"And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore."
19106032,19,106,32,"They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;"
19106033,19,106,33,"Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips."
19106034,19,106,34,"They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,"
19106035,19,106,35,"But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,"
19106036,19,106,36,"And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them."
19106037,19,106,37,"Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,"
19106038,19,106,38,"And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood."
19106039,19,106,39,"Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings."
19106040,19,106,40,"Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance."
19106041,19,106,41,And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.
19106042,19,106,42,"Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand."
19106043,19,106,43,"Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity."
19106044,19,106,44,"Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:"
19106045,19,106,45,"And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses."
19106046,19,106,46,He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive.
19106047,19,106,47,"Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise."
19106048,19,106,48,"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah."
19107001,19,107,1,O give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever.
19107002,19,107,2,"Let the redeemed of Jehovah say `so', Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,"
19107003,19,107,3,"And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south."
19107004,19,107,4,They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.
19107005,19,107,5,"Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them."
19107006,19,107,6,"Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,"
19107007,19,107,7,"He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation."
19107008,19,107,8,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!"
19107009,19,107,9,"For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good."
19107010,19,107,10,"Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,"
19107011,19,107,11,"Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:"
19107012,19,107,12,"Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help."
19107013,19,107,13,"Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses."
19107014,19,107,14,"He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder."
19107015,19,107,15,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!"
19107016,19,107,16,"For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder."
19107017,19,107,17,"Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted."
19107018,19,107,18,Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death.
19107019,19,107,19,"Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses."
19107020,19,107,20,"He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth `them' from their destructions."
19107021,19,107,21,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!"
19107022,19,107,22,"And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing."
19107023,19,107,23,"They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;"
19107024,19,107,24,"These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep."
19107025,19,107,25,"For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof."
19107026,19,107,26,"They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble."
19107027,19,107,27,"They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits' end."
19107028,19,107,28,"Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses."
19107029,19,107,29,"He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still."
19107030,19,107,30,Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
19107031,19,107,31,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!"
19107032,19,107,32,"Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders."
19107033,19,107,33,"He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;"
19107034,19,107,34,"A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein."
19107035,19,107,35,"He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings."
19107036,19,107,36,"And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,"
19107037,19,107,37,"And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase."
19107038,19,107,38,"He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease."
19107039,19,107,39,"Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow."
19107040,19,107,40,"He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way."
19107041,19,107,41,"Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh `him' families like a flock."
19107042,19,107,42,"The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth."
19107043,19,107,43,"Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah. Psalm 108 A Song, A Psalm of David."
19108001,19,108,1,"My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory."
19108002,19,108,2,"Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early."
19108003,19,108,3,"I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples; And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations."
19108004,19,108,4,For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; And thy truth `reacheth' unto the skies.
19108005,19,108,5,"Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth."
19108006,19,108,6,"That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us."
19108007,19,108,7,"God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth."
19108008,19,108,8,Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.
19108009,19,108,9,Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe; Over Philistia will I shout.
19108010,19,108,10,Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
19108011,19,108,11,"Hast not thou cast us off, O God? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts."
19108012,19,108,12,Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.
19108013,19,108,13,Through God we shall do valiantly: For he it is that will tread down our adversaries. Psalm 109 For the Chief Musicion. A Psalm of David.
19109001,19,109,1,"Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;"
19109002,19,109,2,For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.
19109003,19,109,3,"They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause."
19109004,19,109,4,For my love they are my adversaries: But I `give myself unto' prayer.
19109005,19,109,5,"And they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love."
19109006,19,109,6,Set thou a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand.
19109007,19,109,7,"When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin."
19109008,19,109,8,Let his days be few; `And' let another take his office.
19109009,19,109,9,"Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow."
19109010,19,109,10,"Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek `their bread' out of their desolate places."
19109011,19,109,11,Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.
19109012,19,109,12,Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
19109013,19,109,13,Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
19109014,19,109,14,Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
19109015,19,109,15,"Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;"
19109016,19,109,16,"Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay `them'."
19109017,19,109,17,"Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him."
19109018,19,109,18,"He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones."
19109019,19,109,19,"Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually."
19109020,19,109,20,"This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul."
19109021,19,109,21,"But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy name's sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;"
19109022,19,109,22,"For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me."
19109023,19,109,23,I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
19109024,19,109,24,My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness.
19109025,19,109,25,"I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head."
19109026,19,109,26,"Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:"
19109027,19,109,27,"That they may know that this is thy hand; `That' thou, Jehovah, hast done it."
19109028,19,109,28,"Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice."
19109029,19,109,29,"Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe."
19109030,19,109,30,"I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude."
19109031,19,109,31,"For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul. Psalm 110 A Psalm of David."
19110001,19,110,1,"Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool."
19110002,19,110,2,Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
19110003,19,110,3,"Thy people offer themselves willingly In the day of thy power, in holy array: Out of the womb of the morning Thou hast the dew of thy youth."
19110004,19,110,4,"Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek."
19110005,19,110,5,The Lord at thy right hand Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
19110006,19,110,6,"He will judge among the nations, He will fill `the places' with dead bodies; He will strike through the head in many countries."
19110007,19,110,7,He will drink of the brook in the way: Therefore will he lift up the head.
19111001,19,111,1,"Praise ye Jehovah. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in the congregation."
19111002,19,111,2,"The works of Jehovah are great, Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein."
19111003,19,111,3,His work is honor and majesty; And his righteousness endureth for ever.
19111004,19,111,4,He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful.
19111005,19,111,5,He hath given food unto them that fear him: He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
19111006,19,111,6,"He hath showed his people the power of his works, In giving them the heritage of the nations."
19111007,19,111,7,The works of his hands are truth and justice; All his precepts are sure.
19111008,19,111,8,They are established for ever and ever; They are done in truth and uprightness.
19111009,19,111,9,He hath sent redemption unto his people; He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend is his name.

19116012,19,116,12,What shall I render unto Jehovah For all his benefits toward me?
19116013,19,116,13,"I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of Jehovah."
19116014,19,116,14,"I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people."
19116015,19,116,15,Precious in the sight of Jehovah Is the death of his saints.
19116016,19,116,16,"O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bonds."

19118006,19,118,6,Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear: What can man do unto me?
19118007,19,118,7,Jehovah is on my side among them that help me: Therefore shall I see `my desire' upon them that hate me.
19118008,19,118,8,It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to put confidence in man.
19118009,19,118,9,It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to put confidence in princes.

19118011,19,118,11,"They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off."
19118012,19,118,12,They compassed me about like bees; They are quenched as the fire of thorns: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.
19118013,19,118,13,Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall; But Jehovah helped me.
19118014,19,118,14,Jehovah is my strength and song; And he is become my salvation.

19118021,19,118,21,"I will give thanks unto thee; for thou hast answered me, And art become my salvation."
19118022,19,118,22,The stone which the builders rejected Is become the head of the corner.
19118023,19,118,23,This is Jehovah's doing; It is marvellous in our eyes.
19118024,19,118,24,This is the day which Jehovah hath made; We will rejoice and be glad in it.
19118025,19,118,25,"Save now, we beseech thee, O Jehovah: O Jehovah, we beseech thee, send now prosperity."

19118029,19,118,29,Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever.
19119001,19,119,1,"ALEPH. Blessed are they that are perfect in the way, Who walk in the law of Jehovah."

19119010,19,119,10,With my whole heart have I sought thee: Oh let me not wander from thy commandments.
19119011,19,119,11,"Thy word have I laid up in my heart, That I might not sin against thee."
19119012,19,119,12,"Blessed art thou, O Jehovah: Teach me thy statutes."
19119013,19,119,13,With my lips have I declared All the ordinances of thy mouth.
19119014,19,119,14,"I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, As much as in all riches."

19119050,19,119,50,This is my comfort in my affliction; For thy word hath quickened me.
19119051,19,119,51,The proud have had me greatly in derision: `Yet' have I not swerved from thy law.
19119052,19,119,52,"I have remembered thine ordinances of old, O Jehovah, And have comforted myself."

19137001,19,137,1,"By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion."
19137002,19,137,2,Upon the willows in the midst thereof We hanged up our harps.
19137003,19,137,3,"For there they that led us captive required of us songs, And they that wasted us `required of us' mirth, `saying', Sing us one of the songs of Zion."
19137004,19,137,4,How shall we sing Jehovah's song In a foreign land?

19137006,19,137,6,"Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I remember thee not; If I prefer not Jerusalem Above my chief joy."
19137007,19,137,7,"Remember, O Jehovah, against the children of Edom The day of Jerusalem; Who said, Rase it, rase it, Even to the foundation thereof."
19137008,19,137,8,"O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed, Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee As thou hast served us."

19139002,19,139,2,Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising; Thou understandest my thought afar off.
19139003,19,139,3,"Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, And art acquainted with all my ways."
19139004,19,139,4,"For there is not a word in my tongue, But, lo, O Jehovah, thou knowest it altogether."
19139005,19,139,5,"Thou hast beset me behind and before, And laid thy hand upon me."
19139006,19,139,6,"`Such' knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain unto it."

19139010,19,139,10,"Even there shall thy hand lead me, And thy right hand shall hold me."
19139011,19,139,11,"If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me, And the light about me shall be night;"
19139012,19,139,12,"Even the darkness hideth not from thee, But the night shineth as the day: The darkness and the light are both alike `to thee'."
19139013,19,139,13,For thou didst form my inward parts: Thou didst cover me in my mother's womb.
19139014,19,139,14,I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: Wonderful are thy works; And that my soul knoweth right well.
19139015,19,139,15,"My frame was not hidden from thee, When I was made in secret, `And' curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth."
19139016,19,139,16,"Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance; And in thy book they were all written, `Even' the days that were ordained `for me', When as yet there was none of them."
19139017,19,139,17,"How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!"
19139018,19,139,18,"If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: When I awake, I am still with thee."
19139019,19,139,19,"Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men."

19140002,19,140,2,Who devise mischiefs in their heart; Continually do they gather themselves together for war.
19140003,19,140,3,They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; Adders' poison is under their lips. Selah
19140004,19,140,4,"Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps."

19141001,19,141,1,"Jehovah, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me: Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee."
19141002,19,141,2,Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
19141003,19,141,3,"Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth; Keep the door of my lips."
19141004,19,141,4,"Incline not my heart to any evil thing, To practise deeds of wickedness With men that work iniquity: And let me not eat of their dainties."
19141005,19,141,5,"Let the righteous smite me, `it shall be' a kindness; And let him reprove me, `it shall be as' oil upon the head; Let not my head refuse it: For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue."
19141006,19,141,6,Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
19141007,19,141,7,"As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth, Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol."
19141008,19,141,8,"For mine eyes are unto thee, O Jehovah the Lord: In thee do I take refuge; leave not my soul destitute."

19142001,19,142,1,I cry with my voice unto Jehovah; With my voice unto Jehovah do I make supplication.
19142002,19,142,2,I pour out my complaint before him; I show before him my trouble.
19142003,19,142,3,"When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walk Have they hidden a snare for me."
19142004,19,142,4,"Look on `my' right hand, and see; For there is no man that knoweth me: Refuge hath failed me; No man careth for my soul."
19142005,19,142,5,"I cried unto thee, O Jehovah; I said, Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living."
19142006,19,142,6,Attend unto my cry; For I am brought very low: Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are stronger than I.
19142007,19,142,7,"Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks unto thy name: The righteous shall compass me about; For thou wilt deal bountifully with me. Psalm 143 A Psalm of David."

19143002,19,143,2,And enter not into judgment with thy servant; For in thy sight no man living is righteous.
19143003,19,143,3,"For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; He hath smitten my life down to the ground: He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead."
19143004,19,143,4,Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is desolate.
19143005,19,143,5,I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy doings; I muse on the work of thy hands.
19143006,19,143,6,"I spread forth my hands unto thee: My soul `thirsteth' after thee, as a weary land. Selah"
19143007,19,143,7,"Make haste to answer me, O Jehovah; my spirit faileth: Hide not thy face from me, Lest I become like them that go down into the pit."
19143008,19,143,8,Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; For in thee do I trust: Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; For I lift up my soul unto thee.
19143009,19,143,9,"Deliver me, O Jehovah, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me."
19143010,19,143,10,Teach me to do thy will; For thou art my God: Thy Spirit is good; Lead me in the land of uprightness.

19144002,19,144,2,"My lovingkindness, and my fortress, My high tower, and my deliverer; My shield, and he in whom I take refuge; Who subdueth my people under me."
19144003,19,144,3,"Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?"
19144004,19,144,4,Man is like to vanity: His days are as a shadow that passeth away.
19144005,19,144,5,"Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down: Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke."
19144006,19,144,6,"Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them."

19144010,19,144,10,Thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings; Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
19144011,19,144,11,"Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood."
19144012,19,144,12,"When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth, And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace;"
19144013,19,144,13,"`When' our garners are full, affording all manner of store, `And' our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;"

19147015,19,147,15,He sendeth out his commandment upon earth; His word runneth very swiftly.
19147016,19,147,16,He giveth snow like wool; He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
19147017,19,147,17,He casteth forth his ice like morsels: Who can stand before his cold?
19147018,19,147,18,"He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow."

19148008,19,148,8,"Fire and hail, snow and vapor; Stormy wind, fulfilling his word;"
19148009,19,148,9,Mountains and all hills; Fruitful trees and all cedars;
19148010,19,148,10,Beasts and all cattle; Creeping things and flying birds;
19148011,19,148,11,Kings of the earth and all peoples; Princes and all judges of the earth;
