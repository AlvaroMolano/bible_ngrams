01001001,1,1,1,In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
01001002,1,1,2,"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
01001003,1,1,3,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
01001004,1,1,4,"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness."
01001005,1,1,5,"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night: and the evening and the morning were the first day."
01001006,1,1,6,"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
01001007,1,1,7,And God made the firmament; and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
01001008,1,1,8,And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and the morning were the second day.
01001009,1,1,9,"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so."
01001010,1,1,10,"And God called the dry land Earth, and the collection of waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good."
01001011,1,1,11,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so."
01001012,1,1,12,"And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good."
01001013,1,1,13,And the evening and the morning were the third day.
01001014,1,1,14,"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years."
01001015,1,1,15,"And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so."
01001016,1,1,16,"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also."
01001017,1,1,17,"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth."
01001018,1,1,18,"And to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good."
01001019,1,1,19,And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
01001020,1,1,20,"And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."
01001021,1,1,21,"And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
01001022,1,1,22,"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."
01001023,1,1,23,And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
01001024,1,1,24,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and the creeping animal, and the beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."
01001025,1,1,25,"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
01001026,1,1,26,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth."
01001027,1,1,27,"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
01001028,1,1,28,"And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living animal that moveth upon the earth."
01001029,1,1,29,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food."
01001030,1,1,30,"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every animal that creepeth upon the earth, in which is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so."
01001031,1,1,31,"And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."
01002001,1,2,1,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
01002002,1,2,2,And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
01002003,1,2,3,"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
01002004,1,2,4,"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens."
01002005,1,2,5,"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground."
01002006,1,2,6,"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."
01002007,1,2,7,"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
01002008,1,2,8,And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
01002009,1,2,9,"And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
01002010,1,2,10,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden: and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."
01002011,1,2,11,"The name of the first is Pison, which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;"
01002012,1,2,12,And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx-stone.
01002013,1,2,13,And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
01002014,1,2,14,And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: which floweth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
01002015,1,2,15,"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it."
01002016,1,2,16,"And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:"
01002017,1,2,17,"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die."
01002018,1,2,18,"And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make him a help meet for him."
01002019,1,2,19,"And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was its name."
01002020,1,2,20,"And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to every beast of the field: but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him."
01002021,1,2,21,"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place."
01002022,1,2,22,"And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, he made woman, and brought her to the man."
01002023,1,2,23,"And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man."
01002024,1,2,24,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
01002025,1,2,25,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
01003001,1,3,1,"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made: and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"
01003002,1,3,2,"And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:"
01003003,1,3,3,"But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
01003004,1,3,4,"And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
01003005,1,3,5,"For God doth know, that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened: and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."
01003006,1,3,6,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise; she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate."
01003007,1,3,7,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked: and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made for themselves aprons."
01003008,1,3,8,And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
01003009,1,3,9,"And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where art thou?"
01003010,1,3,10,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden: and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
01003011,1,3,11,"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat?"
01003012,1,3,12,"And the man said, The woman, whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."
01003013,1,3,13,"And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate."
01003014,1,3,14,"And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field: upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:"
01003015,1,3,15,"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
01003016,1,3,16,"To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children: and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
01003017,1,3,17,"And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;"
01003018,1,3,18,Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
01003019,1,3,19,"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return."
01003020,1,3,20,"And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living."
01003021,1,3,21,"For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them."
01003022,1,3,22,"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man hath become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:"
01003023,1,3,23,"Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken."
01003024,1,3,24,"So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
01004001,1,4,1,"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD."
01004002,1,4,2,"And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
01004003,1,4,3,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD."
01004004,1,4,4,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel, and to his offering:"
01004005,1,4,5,"But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell."
01004006,1,4,6,"And the LORD said to Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?"
01004007,1,4,7,"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And to thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him."
01004008,1,4,8,"And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
01004009,1,4,9,"And the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?"
01004010,1,4,10,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the ground."
01004011,1,4,11,"And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;"
01004012,1,4,12,"When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength: A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth."
01004013,1,4,13,"And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear."
01004014,1,4,14,"Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it will come to pass, that every one that findeth me will slay me."
01004015,1,4,15,"And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him."
01004016,1,4,16,"And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."
01004017,1,4,17,"And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son Enoch."
01004018,1,4,18,And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
01004019,1,4,19,"And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
01004020,1,4,20,"And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle."
01004021,1,4,21,And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
01004022,1,4,22,"And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah."
01004023,1,4,23,"And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt."
01004024,1,4,24,"If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold."
01004025,1,4,25,"And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."
01004026,1,4,26,"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD."
01005001,1,5,1,"This is the book of the generations of Adam: In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him:"
01005002,1,5,2,"Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created."
01005003,1,5,3,"And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:"
01005004,1,5,4,And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:
01005005,1,5,5,And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
01005006,1,5,6,"And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enos:"
01005007,1,5,7,"And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:"
01005008,1,5,8,And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
01005009,1,5,9,"And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan."
01005010,1,5,10,"And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:"
01005011,1,5,11,And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
01005012,1,5,12,"And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:"
01005013,1,5,13,"And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
01005014,1,5,14,And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
01005015,1,5,15,"And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:"
01005016,1,5,16,"And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
01005017,1,5,17,And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years; and he died.
01005018,1,5,18,"And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:"
01005019,1,5,19,"And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
01005020,1,5,20,And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years; and he died.
01005021,1,5,21,"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:"
01005022,1,5,22,"And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
01005023,1,5,23,And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
01005024,1,5,24,"And Enoch walked with God, and he was not: for God took him."
01005025,1,5,25,"And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:"
01005026,1,5,26,"And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:"
01005027,1,5,27,And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.
01005028,1,5,28,And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years; and begat a son:
01005029,1,5,29,"And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed."
01005030,1,5,30,"And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:"
01005031,1,5,31,And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.
01005032,1,5,32,"And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
01006001,1,6,1,"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,"
01006002,1,6,2,That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all whom they chose.
01006003,1,6,3,"And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years."
01006004,1,6,4,"There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them: the same became mighty men, who were of old, men of renown."
01006005,1,6,5,"And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
01006006,1,6,6,"And the LORD repented that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart."
01006007,1,6,7,"And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created, from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping animal, and the fowls of the air; for I repent that I have made them."
01006008,1,6,8,But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
01006009,1,6,9,"These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God."
01006010,1,6,10,"And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
01006011,1,6,11,The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence.
01006012,1,6,12,"And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt: for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth."
01006013,1,6,13,"And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them: and behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
01006014,1,6,14,"Make thee an ark of gopher-wood: rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch."
01006015,1,6,15,"And this is the fashion in which thou shalt make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits."
01006016,1,6,16,"A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side: with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it."
01006017,1,6,17,"And behold, I, even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, in which is the breath of life, from under heaven: and every thing that is on the earth shall die."
01006018,1,6,18,"But with thee will I establish my covenant: and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee."
01006019,1,6,19,"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee: they shall be male and female."
01006020,1,6,20,"Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping animal of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come to thee, to keep them alive."
01006021,1,6,21,"And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them."
01006022,1,6,22,"Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."
01007001,1,7,1,"And the LORD said to Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark: for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation."
01007002,1,7,2,"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female."
01007003,1,7,3,"Of fowls of the air also by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth."
01007004,1,7,4,"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights: and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from the face of the earth."
01007005,1,7,5,And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.
01007006,1,7,6,And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.
01007007,1,7,7,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."
01007008,1,7,8,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every animal that creepeth upon the earth;"
01007009,1,7,9,"There went in two and two to Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah."
01007010,1,7,10,"And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth."
01007011,1,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
01007012,1,7,12,And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
01007013,1,7,13,"In the same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark."
01007014,1,7,14,"They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort."
01007015,1,7,15,"And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which is the breath of life."
01007016,1,7,16,"And they that entered, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in."
01007017,1,7,17,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth: and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth."
01007018,1,7,18,"And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth: and the ark moved upon the face of the waters."
01007019,1,7,19,And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered.
01007020,1,7,20,Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail: and the mountains were covered.
01007021,1,7,21,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:"
01007022,1,7,22,"All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was on the dry land, died."
01007023,1,7,23,"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping animals, and the fowl of heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth; and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark."
01007024,1,7,24,And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
01008001,1,8,1,"And God remembered Noah, and every living animal, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were checked."
01008002,1,8,2,"The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"
01008003,1,8,3,And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
01008004,1,8,4,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
01008005,1,8,5,"And the waters decreased continually, till the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen."
01008006,1,8,6,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"
01008007,1,8,7,"And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, till the waters were dried from off the earth."
01008008,1,8,8,"Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;"
01008009,1,8,9,"But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark."
01008010,1,8,10,"And he stayed yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;"
01008011,1,8,11,"And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth was an olive-leaf plucked off: So Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth."
01008012,1,8,12,"And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; which returned not again to him any more."
01008013,1,8,13,"And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry."
01008014,1,8,14,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried."
01008015,1,8,15,"And God spoke to Noah, saying,"
01008016,1,8,16,"Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee."
01008017,1,8,17,"Bring forth with thee every living animal that is with thee, of all flesh, of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."
01008018,1,8,18,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:"
01008019,1,8,19,"Every beast, every creeping animal, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark."
01008020,1,8,20,"And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar."
01008021,1,8,21,"And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth: neither will I again smite any more every living animal as I have done."
01008022,1,8,22,"While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
01009001,1,9,1,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."
01009002,1,9,2,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth on the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered."
01009003,1,9,3,Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things:
01009004,1,9,4,"But flesh with the life of it, which is its blood, shall ye not eat."
01009005,1,9,5,"And surely your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man."
01009006,1,9,6,"Whoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man."
01009007,1,9,7,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply, bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein."
01009008,1,9,8,"And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"
01009009,1,9,9,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
01009010,1,9,10,"And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth."
01009011,1,9,11,And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
01009012,1,9,12,"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations."
01009013,1,9,13,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth."
01009014,1,9,14,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:"
01009015,1,9,15,"And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh."
01009016,1,9,16,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth."
01009017,1,9,17,"And God said to Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."
01009018,1,9,18,"And the sons of Noah that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham was the father of Canaan."
01009019,1,9,19,These three were the sons of Noah: and from them was the whole earth overspread.
01009020,1,9,20,"And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:"
01009021,1,9,21,"And he drank the wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent."
01009022,1,9,22,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without."
01009023,1,9,23,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness."
01009024,1,9,24,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him."
01009025,1,9,25,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren."
01009026,1,9,26,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
01009027,1,9,27,"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
01009028,1,9,28,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
01009029,1,9,29,And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
01010001,1,10,1,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah; Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and to them were sons born after the flood."
01010002,1,10,2,"The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
01010003,1,10,3,"And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
01010004,1,10,4,"And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
01010005,1,10,5,"By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."
01010006,1,10,6,"And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan."
01010007,1,10,7,"And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha; and the sons of Raamah, Sheba, and Dedan."
01010008,1,10,8,And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
01010009,1,10,9,"He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD."
01010010,1,10,10,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
01010011,1,10,11,"Out of that land went forth Ashur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,"
01010012,1,10,12,And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.
01010013,1,10,13,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim."
01010014,1,10,14,"And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim."
01010015,1,10,15,"And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,"
01010016,1,10,16,"And the Jebusite, and the Emorite, and the Girgasite,"
01010017,1,10,17,"And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
01010018,1,10,18,"And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites dispersed."
01010019,1,10,19,"And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, to Gaza; as thou goest to Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lashah."
01010020,1,10,20,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations."
01010021,1,10,21,"To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born."
01010022,1,10,22,"The children of Shem; Elam, and Ashur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
01010023,1,10,23,"And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
01010024,1,10,24,And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
01010025,1,10,25,"And to Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan."
01010026,1,10,26,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
01010027,1,10,27,"And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah."
01010028,1,10,28,"And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
01010029,1,10,29,"And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan."
01010030,1,10,30,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest to Sephar, a mount of the east."
01010031,1,10,31,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
01010032,1,10,32,"These are the families of the sons of Noah after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood."
01011001,1,11,1,"And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech."
01011002,1,11,2,"And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there."
01011003,1,11,3,"And they said one to another, come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar."
01011004,1,11,4,"And they said, come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we should be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
01011005,1,11,5,"And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men were building."
01011006,1,11,6,"And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."
01011007,1,11,7,"Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
01011008,1,11,8,So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
01011009,1,11,9,"Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the LORD there confounded the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth."
01011010,1,11,10,"These are the generations of Shem: Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:"
01011011,1,11,11,"And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
01011012,1,11,12,"And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah."
01011013,1,11,13,"And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
01011014,1,11,14,"And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:"
01011015,1,11,15,"And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
01011016,1,11,16,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:"
01011017,1,11,17,"And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters."
01011018,1,11,18,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:"
01011019,1,11,19,"And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters."
01011020,1,11,20,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug."
01011021,1,11,21,"And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters."
01011022,1,11,22,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:"
01011023,1,11,23,"And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
01011024,1,11,24,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah."
01011025,1,11,25,"And Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters."
01011026,1,11,26,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
01011027,1,11,27,"Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran: and Haran begat Lot."
01011028,1,11,28,"And Haran died before his father Terah, in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees."
01011029,1,11,29,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah."
01011030,1,11,30,But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
01011031,1,11,31,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelt there."
01011032,1,11,32,And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
01012001,1,12,1,"Now the LORD had said to Abram, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to a land that I will show thee:"
01012002,1,12,2,"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:"
01012003,1,12,3,"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."
01012004,1,12,4,"So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed from Haran."
01012005,1,12,5,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."
01012006,1,12,6,"And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land."
01012007,1,12,7,"And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him."
01012008,1,12,8,"And he removed from thence to a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD."
01012009,1,12,9,"And Abram journeyed, going on still towards the south."
01012010,1,12,10,And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
01012011,1,12,11,"And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:"
01012012,1,12,12,"Therefore it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive."
01012013,1,12,13,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee."
01012014,1,12,14,"And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair."
01012015,1,12,15,"The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."
01012016,1,12,16,"And he treated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels."
01012017,1,12,17,"And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram's wife."
01012018,1,12,18,"And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife?"
01012019,1,12,19,"Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me for a wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way."
01012020,1,12,20,"And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had."
01013001,1,13,1,"And Abram returned from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south."
01013002,1,13,2,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
01013003,1,13,3,"And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai;"
01013004,1,13,4,"To the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD."
01013005,1,13,5,"And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents."
01013006,1,13,6,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together."
01013007,1,13,7,And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
01013008,1,13,8,"And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren."
01013009,1,13,9,"Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou wilt depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
01013010,1,13,10,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest to Zoar."
01013011,1,13,11,Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
01013012,1,13,12,"Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent towards Sodom."
01013013,1,13,13,"But the men of Sodom were wicked, and sinners before the LORD, exceedingly."
01013014,1,13,14,"And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:"
01013015,1,13,15,"For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."
01013016,1,13,16,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered."
01013017,1,13,17,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee."
01013018,1,13,18,"Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD."
01014001,1,14,1,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;"
01014002,1,14,2,"That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar."
01014003,1,14,3,"All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea."
01014004,1,14,4,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
01014005,1,14,5,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
01014006,1,14,6,"And the Horites in their mount Seir, to El-paran, which is by the wilderness."
01014007,1,14,7,"And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar."
01014008,1,14,8,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;"
01014009,1,14,9,"With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five."
01014010,1,14,10,"And the vale of Siddim was full of slime-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there: and they that remained fled to the mountain."
01014011,1,14,11,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way."
01014012,1,14,12,"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
01014013,1,14,13,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram."
01014014,1,14,14,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan."
01014015,1,14,15,"And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus."
01014016,1,14,16,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people."
01014017,1,14,17,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale."
01014018,1,14,18,"And Melchisedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God."
01014019,1,14,19,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:"
01014020,1,14,20,"And blessed be the most high God, who hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all."
01014021,1,14,21,"And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself."
01014022,1,14,22,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,"
01014023,1,14,23,"That I will not take from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:"
01014024,1,14,24,"Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion."
01015001,1,15,1,"After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward."
01015002,1,15,2,"And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"
01015003,1,15,3,"And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and lo, one born in my house is my heir."
01015004,1,15,4,"And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, This shall not be thy heir; but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir."
01015005,1,15,5,"And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towards heaven, and tell the stars, if thou art able to number them: and he said to him, So shall thy seed be."
01015006,1,15,6,And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
01015007,1,15,7,"And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it."
01015008,1,15,8,"And he said, Lord GOD, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
01015009,1,15,9,"And he said to him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon."
01015010,1,15,10,"And he took to him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds he did not divide."
01015011,1,15,11,"And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away."
01015012,1,15,12,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him."
01015013,1,15,13,"And he said to Abram, Know certainly that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;"
01015014,1,15,14,"And also that nation which they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."
01015015,1,15,15,And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
01015016,1,15,16,But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
01015017,1,15,17,"And it came to pass, that when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces."
01015018,1,15,18,"In that same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:"
01015019,1,15,19,"The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,"
01015020,1,15,20,"And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,"
01015021,1,15,21,"And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
01016001,1,16,1,"Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar."
01016002,1,16,2,"And Sarai said to Abram, Behold, now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."
01016003,1,16,3,"And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife."
01016004,1,16,4,"And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
01016005,1,16,5,"And Sarai said to Abram, my wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee."
01016006,1,16,6,"But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face."
01016007,1,16,7,"And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur."
01016008,1,16,8,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai."
01016009,1,16,9,"And the angel of the LORD said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands."
01016010,1,16,10,"And the angel of the LORD said to her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
01016011,1,16,11,"And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction."
01016012,1,16,12,"And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren."
01016013,1,16,13,"And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?"
01016014,1,16,14,"Wherefore the well was called Beer-la-hai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
01016015,1,16,15,"And Hagar bore Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael."
01016016,1,16,16,"And Abram was eighty six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram."
01017001,1,17,1,"And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect."
01017002,1,17,2,"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly."
01017003,1,17,3,"And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,"
01017004,1,17,4,"As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations."
01017005,1,17,5,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee."
01017006,1,17,6,"And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee; and kings shall proceed from thee."
01017007,1,17,7,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant; to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee."
01017008,1,17,8,"And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
01017009,1,17,9,"And God said to Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee, in their generations."
01017010,1,17,10,"This is my covenant, which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee; Every male-child among you shall be circumcised."
01017011,1,17,11,And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
01017012,1,17,12,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male-child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, who is not of thy seed."
01017013,1,17,13,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
01017014,1,17,14,"And the uncircumcised male-child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant."
01017015,1,17,15,"And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be."
01017016,1,17,16,"And I will bless her, and give thee a son also by her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall proceed from her."
01017017,1,17,17,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?"
01017018,1,17,18,"And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!"
01017019,1,17,19,"And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him."
01017020,1,17,20,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
01017021,1,17,21,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year."
01017022,1,17,22,"And he ceased talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
01017023,1,17,23,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin, in the same day, as God had said to him."
01017024,1,17,24,"And Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
01017025,1,17,25,"And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
01017026,1,17,26,"In the same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
01017027,1,17,27,"And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him."
01018001,1,18,1,And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
01018002,1,18,2,"And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,"
01018003,1,18,3,"And said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:"
01018004,1,18,4,"Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:"
01018005,1,18,5,"And I will bring a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said."
01018006,1,18,6,"And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth."
01018007,1,18,7,"And Abraham ran to the herd, and brought a calf tender and good, and gave it to a young man; and he hasted to dress it."
01018008,1,18,8,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate."
01018009,1,18,9,"And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent."
01018010,1,18,10,"And he said, I will certainly return to thee according to the time of life; and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him."
01018011,1,18,11,Now Abraham and Sarah were old and far advanced in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
01018012,1,18,12,"Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
01018013,1,18,13,"And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?"
01018014,1,18,14,"Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son."
01018015,1,18,15,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh."
01018016,1,18,16,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."
01018017,1,18,17,"And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;"
01018018,1,18,18,"Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
01018019,1,18,19,"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they will keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him."
01018020,1,18,20,"And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
01018021,1,18,21,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know."
01018022,1,18,22,"And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towards Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD."
01018023,1,18,23,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
01018024,1,18,24,Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are in it?
01018025,1,18,25,"That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
01018026,1,18,26,"And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."
01018027,1,18,27,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I, who am dust and ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the Lord."
01018028,1,18,28,"Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it."
01018029,1,18,29,"And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake."
01018030,1,18,30,"And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there will thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
01018031,1,18,31,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord: Peradventure there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake."
01018032,1,18,32,"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake."
01018033,1,18,33,"And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place."
01019001,1,19,1,"And there came two angels to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom; and Lot seeing them, rose to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground;"
01019002,1,19,2,"And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night."
01019003,1,19,3,"And he urged them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate."
01019004,1,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:"
01019005,1,19,5,"And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came in to thee this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them."
01019006,1,19,6,"And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,"
01019007,1,19,7,"And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly."
01019008,1,19,8,"Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof."
01019009,1,19,9,"And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one man came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: Now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard upon the man, Lot, and came near to break the door."
01019010,1,19,10,"But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door."
01019011,1,19,11,"And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door."
01019012,1,19,12,"And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:"
01019013,1,19,13,"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them has become great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it."
01019014,1,19,14,"And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Arise, depart from this place; for the LORD will destroy this city: but he seemed to his sons-in-law as one that mocked."
01019015,1,19,15,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
01019016,1,19,16,"And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters: the LORD being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city."
01019017,1,19,17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life: look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain: escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."
01019018,1,19,18,"And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my Lord!"
01019019,1,19,19,"Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown to me in saving my life: and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil should take me, and I die:"
01019020,1,19,20,"Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a small one: Oh, let me escape thither! (Is it not a small one?) and my soul shall live."
01019021,1,19,21,"And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for which thou hast spoken."
01019022,1,19,22,"Haste thee, escape thither: for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come thither: therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
01019023,1,19,23,The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
01019024,1,19,24,Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
01019025,1,19,25,"And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
01019026,1,19,26,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
01019027,1,19,27,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, to the place were he stood before the LORD:"
01019028,1,19,28,"And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
01019029,1,19,29,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt."
01019030,1,19,30,"And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he, and his two daughters."
01019031,1,19,31,"And the first-born said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:"
01019032,1,19,32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
01019033,1,19,33,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
01019034,1,19,34,"And it came to pass on the morrow that the first born said to the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
01019035,1,19,35,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
01019036,1,19,36,Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
01019037,1,19,37,"And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day."
01019038,1,19,38,"And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day."
01020001,1,20,1,"And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the south country, and dwelt between Kadash and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."
01020002,1,20,2,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister: And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah."
01020003,1,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, on account of the woman whom thou hast taken: for she is a man's wife."
01020004,1,20,4,"But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou also slay a righteous nation?"
01020005,1,20,5,"Said he not to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart, and innocence of my hands have I done this."
01020006,1,20,6,"And God said to him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore I suffered thee not to touch her."
01020007,1,20,7,"Now therefore restore to the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou shalt not restore her, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine."
01020008,1,20,8,"Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were greatly afraid."
01020009,1,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What has thou done to us? and in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done."
01020010,1,20,10,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
01020011,1,20,11,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake."
01020012,1,20,12,"And yet indeed she is my sister: she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
01020013,1,20,13,"And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show to me; At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother."
01020014,1,20,14,"And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife."
01020015,1,20,15,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee."
01020016,1,20,16,"And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, to all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved."
01020017,1,20,17,"So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, and they bore children."
01020018,1,20,18,"For the LORD had made barren all the females of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."
01021001,1,21,1,"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken."
01021002,1,21,2,"For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
01021003,1,21,3,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac."
01021004,1,21,4,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him."
01021005,1,21,5,"And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him."
01021006,1,21,6,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me."
01021007,1,21,7,"And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah shall nurse children? for I have borne him a son in his old age."
01021008,1,21,8,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned."
01021009,1,21,9,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne to Abraham, mocking."
01021010,1,21,10,"Wherefore, she said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman, and her son: for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."
01021011,1,21,11,"And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his son."
01021012,1,21,12,"And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the lad, and because of thy bond-woman; in all that Sarah hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
01021013,1,21,13,"And also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed."
01021014,1,21,14,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar (putting it on her shoulder) and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba."
01021015,1,21,15,"And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
01021016,1,21,16,"And she went, and sat her down over against him, a good way off, as it were a bow-shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and raised her voice, and wept."
01021017,1,21,17,"And God heard the voice of the lad: and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is."
01021018,1,21,18,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand: for I will make him a great nation."
01021019,1,21,19,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water: and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink."
01021020,1,21,20,"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
01021021,1,21,21,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
01021022,1,21,22,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:"
01021023,1,21,23,"Now therefore swear to me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou hast sojourned."
01021024,1,21,24,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
01021025,1,21,25,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech, because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away."
01021026,1,21,26,"And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet have I heard of it, but to-day."
01021027,1,21,27,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a covenant."
01021028,1,21,28,And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
01021029,1,21,29,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, What mean these seven ewe-lambs, which thou hast set by themselves?"
01021030,1,21,30,"And he said, For these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that they may be a witness to me, that I have digged this well."
01021031,1,21,31,Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba: because there they swore both of them.
01021032,1,21,32,"Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: Then Abimelech arose, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
01021033,1,21,33,"And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God."
01021034,1,21,34,And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
01022001,1,22,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that God tempted Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am."
01022002,1,22,2,"And he said, Take now thy son, thy only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will name to thee."
01022003,1,22,3,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and cleft the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose and went to the place which God had named to him."
01022004,1,22,4,"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
01022005,1,22,5,"And Abraham said to his young men, Abide you here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and return to you."
01022006,1,22,6,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife: and they went both of them together."
01022007,1,22,7,"And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?"
01022008,1,22,8,"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering: so they went both of them together."
01022009,1,22,9,"And they came to the place which God had named to him; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order; and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."
01022010,1,22,10,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
01022011,1,22,11,"And the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here am I."
01022012,1,22,12,"And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing to him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld from me thy son, thy only son."
01022013,1,22,13,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son."
01022014,1,22,14,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it will be seen."
01022015,1,22,15,"And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven the second time,"
01022016,1,22,16,"And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only son:"
01022017,1,22,17,"That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;"
01022018,1,22,18,And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast obeyed my voice.
01022019,1,22,19,"So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba."
01022020,1,22,20,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children to thy brother Nahor;"
01022021,1,22,21,"Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
01022022,1,22,22,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
01022023,1,22,23,And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah bore to Nahor Abraham's brother.
01022024,1,22,24,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah."
01023001,1,23,1,And Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
01023002,1,23,2,"And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
01023003,1,23,3,"And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,"
01023004,1,23,4,"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
01023005,1,23,5,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,"
01023006,1,23,6,"Hear us, my lord; thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead: none of us will withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead."
01023007,1,23,7,"And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth."
01023008,1,23,8,"And he communed with them, saying, If it is your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,"
01023009,1,23,9,"That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me, for a possession of a burying-place among you."
01023010,1,23,10,"And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, of all that entered the gates of his city, saying,"
01023011,1,23,11,"Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I to thee, and the cave that is in it, I give it to thee; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to thee: bury thy dead."
01023012,1,23,12,And Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land.
01023013,1,23,13,"And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field: take it of me, and I will bury my dead there."
01023014,1,23,14,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,"
01023015,1,23,15,"My lord, hearken to me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead."
01023016,1,23,16,"And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant."
01023017,1,23,17,"And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure"
01023018,1,23,18,"To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that entered the gate of his city."
01023019,1,23,19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan."
01023020,1,23,20,"And the field, and the cave that is in it were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place, by the sons of Heth."
01024001,1,24,1,And Abraham was old and far advanced in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
01024002,1,24,2,"And Abraham said to his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:"
01024003,1,24,3,"And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell:"
01024004,1,24,4,"But thou shalt go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
01024005,1,24,5,"And the servant said to him, It may be the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I needs bring thy son again to the land from whence thou camest?"
01024006,1,24,6,"And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again."
01024007,1,24,7,"The LORD God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence."
01024008,1,24,8,"And if the woman shall not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only bring not my son thither again."
01024009,1,24,9,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter."
01024010,1,24,10,"And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; (for all the goods of his master were in his hands:) and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor."
01024011,1,24,11,"And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water, at the time of the evening, the time when women go out to draw water:"
01024012,1,24,12,"And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, prosper me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham."
01024013,1,24,13,"Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:"
01024014,1,24,14,"And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and by that shall I know that thou hast shown kindness to my master."
01024015,1,24,15,"And it came to pass before he had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder."
01024016,1,24,16,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up."
01024017,1,24,17,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water from thy pitcher."
01024018,1,24,18,"And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink."
01024019,1,24,19,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, till they have done drinking."
01024020,1,24,20,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels."
01024021,1,24,21,"And the man, wondering at her, held his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous, or not."
01024022,1,24,22,"And it came to pass as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ear-ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;"
01024023,1,24,23,"And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?"
01024024,1,24,24,"And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
01024025,1,24,25,"She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."
01024026,1,24,26,"And the man bowed his head, and worshipped the LORD."
01024027,1,24,27,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left my master destitute of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren."
01024028,1,24,28,"And the damsel ran, and told these things to her mother's house."
01024029,1,24,29,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the well."
01024030,1,24,30,"And it came to pass when he saw the ear-ring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and behold, he stood by the camels at the well."
01024031,1,24,31,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; why standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
01024032,1,24,32,"And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him."
01024033,1,24,33,"And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on."
01024034,1,24,34,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant."
01024035,1,24,35,"And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly, and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses."
01024036,1,24,36,"And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old: and to him hath he given all that he hath."
01024037,1,24,37,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:"
01024038,1,24,38,"But thou shalt go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son."
01024039,1,24,39,"And I said to my master, It may be the woman will not follow me."
01024040,1,24,40,"And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house."
01024041,1,24,41,"Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath."
01024042,1,24,42,"And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou dost prosper my way which I go:"
01024043,1,24,43,"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;"
01024044,1,24,44,"And she saith to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath pointed out for my master's son."
01024045,1,24,45,"And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew water: and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee."
01024046,1,24,46,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also."
01024047,1,24,47,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him: and I put the ear-ring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands."
01024048,1,24,48,"And I bowed my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son."
01024049,1,24,49,"And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
01024050,1,24,50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak to thee bad or good."
01024051,1,24,51,"Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken."
01024052,1,24,52,"And it came to pass, that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth."
01024053,1,24,53,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things."
01024054,1,24,54,"And they ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master."
01024055,1,24,55,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go."
01024056,1,24,56,"And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master."
01024057,1,24,57,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth."
01024058,1,24,58,"And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go."
01024059,1,24,59,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men."
01024060,1,24,60,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them."
01024061,1,24,61,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way."
01024062,1,24,62,And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
01024063,1,24,63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold, the camels were coming."
01024064,1,24,64,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel."
01024065,1,24,65,"For she had said to the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail and covered herself."
01024066,1,24,66,And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
01024067,1,24,67,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."
01025001,1,25,1,"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah."
01025002,1,25,2,"And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
01025003,1,25,3,"And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim and Leummim."
01025004,1,25,4,"And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
01025005,1,25,5,And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
01025006,1,25,6,"But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son (while he yet lived) eastward, to the east country."
01025007,1,25,7,"And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred and seventy five years."
01025008,1,25,8,"Then Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people."
01025009,1,25,9,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;"
01025010,1,25,10,"The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
01025011,1,25,11,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac: and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi."
01025012,1,25,12,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham."
01025013,1,25,13,"And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
01025014,1,25,14,"And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
01025015,1,25,15,"Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"
01025016,1,25,16,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations."
01025017,1,25,17,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael; a hundred and thirty and seven years: and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people."
01025018,1,25,18,"And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest towards Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren."
01025019,1,25,19,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:"
01025020,1,25,20,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian."
01025021,1,25,21,"And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
01025022,1,25,22,"And the children struggled together within her: and she said, If it is so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD."
01025023,1,25,23,"And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels: and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger."
01025024,1,25,24,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
01025025,1,25,25,"And the first was born red, all over like a hairy garment: and they called his name Esau."
01025026,1,25,26,"And after that his brother was born, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them."
01025027,1,25,27,"And the boys grew: and Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents."
01025028,1,25,28,"And Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob."
01025029,1,25,29,"And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint."
01025030,1,25,30,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom."
01025031,1,25,31,"And Jacob said, Sell to me this day thy birth-right."
01025032,1,25,32,"And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birth-right bring to me?"
01025033,1,25,33,"And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birth-right to Jacob."
01025034,1,25,34,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way: thus Esau despised his birth-right."
01026001,1,26,1,"And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar."
01026002,1,26,2,"And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt: dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of."
01026003,1,26,3,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee, and to thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father;"
01026004,1,26,4,"And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed:"
01026005,1,26,5,"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
01026006,1,26,6,And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
01026007,1,26,7,"And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon."
01026008,1,26,8,"And it came to pass when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife."
01026009,1,26,9,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, surely she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? and Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I should die on her account."
01026010,1,26,10,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done to us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us."
01026011,1,26,11,"And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
01026012,1,26,12,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundred-fold: and the LORD blessed him:"
01026013,1,26,13,"And the man became great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:"
01026014,1,26,14,"For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and very many servants: And the Philistines envied him."
01026015,1,26,15,"For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth."
01026016,1,26,16,"And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us: for thou art much mightier than we."
01026017,1,26,17,"And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
01026018,1,26,18,And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
01026019,1,26,19,"And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
01026020,1,26,20,"And the herdmen of Gerar contended with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him."
01026021,1,26,21,"And they digged another well, and contended for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah."
01026022,1,26,22,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they did not contend: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
01026023,1,26,23,And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
01026024,1,26,24,"And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."
01026025,1,26,25,"And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well."
01026026,1,26,26,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army."
01026027,1,26,27,"And Isaac said to them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
01026028,1,26,28,"And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;"
01026029,1,26,29,"That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD."
01026030,1,26,30,"And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank."
01026031,1,26,31,"And they rose betimes in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
01026032,1,26,32,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said to him, We have found water."
01026033,1,26,33,And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
01026034,1,26,34,"And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:"
01026035,1,26,35,Who were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.
01027001,1,27,1,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I."
01027002,1,27,2,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:"
01027003,1,27,3,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;"
01027004,1,27,4,"And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die."
01027005,1,27,5,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it."
01027006,1,27,6,"And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,"
01027007,1,27,7,"Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD, before my death."
01027008,1,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, according to that which I command thee."
01027009,1,27,9,"Go now to the flock, and bring me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth:"
01027010,1,27,10,"And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death."
01027011,1,27,11,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:"
01027012,1,27,12,"My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing."
01027013,1,27,13,"And his mother said to him, upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me."
01027014,1,27,14,"And he went, and took, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved."
01027015,1,27,15,"And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob her younger son:"
01027016,1,27,16,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth part of his neck:"
01027017,1,27,17,"And she gave the savory meat, and the bread which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
01027018,1,27,18,"And he came to his father, and said, My father: And he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?"
01027019,1,27,19,"And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
01027020,1,27,20,"And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me."
01027021,1,27,21,"And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou art my very son Esau, or not."
01027022,1,27,22,"And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
01027023,1,27,23,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: So he blessed him."
01027024,1,27,24,"And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am."
01027025,1,27,25,"And he said, bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he ate: and he brought him wine, and he drank."
01027026,1,27,26,"And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
01027027,1,27,27,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:"
01027028,1,27,28,"Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:"
01027029,1,27,29,"Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee."
01027030,1,27,30,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
01027031,1,27,31,"And he also had made savory meat, and brought it to his father; and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me."
01027032,1,27,32,"And Isaac his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born Esau."
01027033,1,27,33,"And Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed."
01027034,1,27,34,"And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father."
01027035,1,27,35,"And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing."
01027036,1,27,36,"And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me twice: he took away my birth-right; and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
01027037,1,27,37,"And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to thee, my son?"
01027038,1,27,38,"And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept."
01027039,1,27,39,"And Isaac his father answered, and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;"
01027040,1,27,40,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother: and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck."
01027041,1,27,41,"And Esau hated Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob."
01027042,1,27,42,"And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee."
01027043,1,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;"
01027044,1,27,44,"And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury shall turn away;"
01027045,1,27,45,"Till thy brother's anger shall turn away from thee, and he shall forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and bring thee from thence. Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?"
01027046,1,27,46,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these who are of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?"
01028001,1,28,1,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
01028002,1,28,2,"Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother."
01028003,1,28,3,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;"
01028004,1,28,4,"And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land in which thou art a stranger, which God gave to Abraham."
01028005,1,28,5,"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
01028006,1,28,6,"When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;"
01028007,1,28,7,"And that Jacob obeyed his father, and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;"
01028008,1,28,8,And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
01028009,1,28,9,"Then went Esau to Ishmael, and took to the wives which he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife."
01028010,1,28,10,"And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went towards Haran."
01028011,1,28,11,"And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set: and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep."
01028012,1,28,12,"And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
01028013,1,28,13,"And behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed."
01028014,1,28,14,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
01028015,1,28,15,"And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land: for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have declared to thee."
01028016,1,28,16,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not."
01028017,1,28,17,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is no other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
01028018,1,28,18,"And Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it."
01028019,1,28,19,And he called the name of that place Beth-el: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
01028020,1,28,20,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,"
01028021,1,28,21,So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
01028022,1,28,22,"And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth to thee."
01029001,1,29,1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east."
01029002,1,29,2,"And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth."
01029003,1,29,3,"And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place."
01029004,1,29,4,"And Jacob said to them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, We are from Haran."
01029005,1,29,5,"And he said to them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? and they said, We know him."
01029006,1,29,6,"And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep."
01029007,1,29,7,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be collected: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them."
01029008,1,29,8,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks are collected, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep."
01029009,1,29,9,"And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them."
01029010,1,29,10,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother; that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
01029011,1,29,11,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
01029012,1,29,12,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father."
01029013,1,29,13,"And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things."
01029014,1,29,14,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh: and he abode with him the space of a month."
01029015,1,29,15,"And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what shall thy wages be?"
01029016,1,29,16,"And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
01029017,1,29,17,"Leah was tender-eyed, but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored."
01029018,1,29,18,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
01029019,1,29,19,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me."
01029020,1,29,20,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had to her."
01029021,1,29,21,"And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife (for my days are fulfilled) that I may go in to her."
01029022,1,29,22,"And Laban assembled all the men of the place, and made a feast."
01029023,1,29,23,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her."
01029024,1,29,24,"And Laban gave to his daughter Leah, Zilpah his maid for a handmaid."
01029025,1,29,25,"And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? why then hast thou deceived me?"
01029026,1,29,26,"And Laban said, it must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born."
01029027,1,29,27,"Fulfill her week, and we will give thee this also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years."
01029028,1,29,28,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel, his daughter, for a wife also."
01029029,1,29,29,"And Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid."
01029030,1,29,30,"And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
01029031,1,29,31,"And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he made her fruitful: but Rachel was barren."
01029032,1,29,32,"And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me."
01029033,1,29,33,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon."
01029034,1,29,34,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband adhere to me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi."
01029035,1,29,35,"And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah, and left bearing."
01030001,1,30,1,"And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
01030002,1,30,2,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
01030003,1,30,3,"And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her."
01030004,1,30,4,"And she gave him Bilhah, her handmaid, for a wife: and Jacob went in to her."
01030005,1,30,5,"And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son."
01030006,1,30,6,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore she called his name Dan."
01030007,1,30,7,"And Bilhah, Rachel's maid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son."
01030008,1,30,8,"And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali."
01030009,1,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah, her maid, and gave her Jacob for a wife."
01030010,1,30,10,"And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a son."
01030011,1,30,11,"And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad."
01030012,1,30,12,"And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a second son."
01030013,1,30,13,"And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher."
01030014,1,30,14,"And Reuben went, in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes."
01030015,1,30,15,"And she said to her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes."
01030016,1,30,16,"And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
01030017,1,30,17,"And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son."
01030018,1,30,18,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar."
01030019,1,30,19,"And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son."
01030020,1,30,20,"And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dower; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun."
01030021,1,30,21,"And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
01030022,1,30,22,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and rendered her fruitful."
01030023,1,30,23,"And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:"
01030024,1,30,24,"And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD will add to me another son."
01030025,1,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country."
01030026,1,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee."
01030027,1,30,27,"And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience, that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake."
01030028,1,30,28,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it."
01030029,1,30,29,"And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle were with me."
01030030,1,30,30,"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?"
01030031,1,30,31,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:"
01030032,1,30,32,"I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire."
01030033,1,30,33,"So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be accounted stolen with me."
01030034,1,30,34,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word."
01030035,1,30,35,"And he removed that day the he-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted; every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hands of his sons."
01030036,1,30,36,And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
01030037,1,30,37,"And Jacob took to him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods."
01030038,1,30,38,"And he set the rods, which he had peeled, before the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs, when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink."
01030039,1,30,39,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted."
01030040,1,30,40,"And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban: and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban's cattle."
01030041,1,30,41,"And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods."
01030042,1,30,42,"But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's."
01030043,1,30,43,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had many cattle, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses."
01031001,1,31,1,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he obtained all this glory."
01031002,1,31,2,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not towards him as before."
01031003,1,31,3,"And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."
01031004,1,31,4,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field to his flock,"
01031005,1,31,5,"And said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not towards me as before: but the God of my father hath been with me."
01031006,1,31,6,And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
01031007,1,31,7,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times: but God suffered him not to hurt me."
01031008,1,31,8,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bore speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy hire; then all the cattle bore ring-streaked."
01031009,1,31,9,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me."
01031010,1,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled."
01031011,1,31,11,"And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I."
01031012,1,31,12,"And he said, Lift up now thy eyes and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth to thee."
01031013,1,31,13,"I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst to me a vow: now arise, depart from this land, and return to the land of thy kindred."
01031014,1,31,14,"And Rachel and Leah answered, and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
01031015,1,31,15,"Are we not counted by him strangers; for he hath sold us, and hath quite consumed also our money."
01031016,1,31,16,"For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then whatever God hath said to thee, do."
01031017,1,31,17,"Then Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;"
01031018,1,31,18,"And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gained, the cattle of his getting, which he had gained in Padan-aram; to go to Isaac, his father, in the land of Canaan."
01031019,1,31,19,And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
01031020,1,31,20,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he was about to depart."
01031021,1,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he arose, and passed over the river, and set his face towards the mount Gilead."
01031022,1,31,22,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
01031023,1,31,23,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey: and they overtook him in the mount Gilead."
01031024,1,31,24,"And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
01031025,1,31,25,"Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban, with his brethren, pitched in the mount of Gilead."
01031026,1,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?"
01031027,1,31,27,"Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?"
01031028,1,31,28,"And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons, and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing."
01031029,1,31,29,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
01031030,1,31,30,"And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou didst earnestly long after thy father's house; yet why hast thou stolen my gods?"
01031031,1,31,31,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, It may be thou wouldest take thy daughters from me by force."
01031032,1,31,32,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee: for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."
01031033,1,31,33,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maid-servants' tents; but he found them not. Then he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent."
01031034,1,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not."
01031035,1,31,35,"And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images."
01031036,1,31,36,"And Jacob was wroth, and chid with Laban: and Jacob answered, and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so eagerly pursued after me?"
01031037,1,31,37,"Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household-stuff? set it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both."
01031038,1,31,38,"These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten."
01031039,1,31,39,"That which was torn by beasts, I brought not to thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night."
01031040,1,31,40,"Thus I was; in the day the drouth consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes."
01031041,1,31,41,"Thus have I been twenty years in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times."
01031042,1,31,42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction, and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight."
01031043,1,31,43,"And Laban answered, and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have borne?"
01031044,1,31,44,"Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee."
01031045,1,31,45,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar."
01031046,1,31,46,"And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they ate there upon the heap."
01031047,1,31,47,And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed:
01031048,1,31,48,"And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:"
01031049,1,31,49,"And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another."
01031050,1,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives besides my daughters; no man is with us; See, God is witness betwixt me and thee."
01031051,1,31,51,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;"
01031052,1,31,52,"This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm."
01031053,1,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac."
01031054,1,31,54,"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mount."
01031055,1,31,55,"And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place."
01032001,1,32,1,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
01032002,1,32,2,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
01032003,1,32,3,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
01032004,1,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there till now:"
01032005,1,32,5,"And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-servants, and women-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight."
01032006,1,32,6,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
01032007,1,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and herds, and camels, into two bands;"
01032008,1,32,8,"And said, If Esau shall come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left, will escape."
01032009,1,32,9,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who saidst to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee;"
01032010,1,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown to thy servant: for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands."
01032011,1,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he shall come and smite me, and the mother with the children."
01032012,1,32,12,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
01032013,1,32,13,"And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau, his brother;"
01032014,1,32,14,"Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,"
01032015,1,32,15,"Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals."
01032016,1,32,16,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove."
01032017,1,32,17,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau, my brother, meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?"
01032018,1,32,18,"Then thou shalt say, They are thy servant Jacob's: it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and behold also he is behind us."
01032019,1,32,19,"And so he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, In this manner shall ye speak to Esau, when ye find him."
01032020,1,32,20,"And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me."
01032021,1,32,21,So the present went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the company.
01032022,1,32,22,"And he arose that night, and took his two wives, and his two women-servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok."
01032023,1,32,23,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that which he had."
01032024,1,32,24,"And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him, until the breaking of the day."
01032025,1,32,25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh: and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him."
01032026,1,32,26,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh; And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
01032027,1,32,27,"And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob."
01032028,1,32,28,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God, and with men, and hast prevailed."
01032029,1,32,29,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name: And he said, why is it that thou dost ask after my name? and he blessed him there."
01032030,1,32,30,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
01032031,1,32,31,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh."
01032032,1,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrunk, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrunk."
01033001,1,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids."
01033002,1,33,2,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost."
01033003,1,33,3,"And he passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, till he came near to his brother."
01033004,1,33,4,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
01033005,1,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given to thy servant."
01033006,1,33,6,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
01033007,1,33,7,"And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
01033008,1,33,8,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, these are to find grace in the sight of my lord."
01033009,1,33,9,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast to thyself."
01033010,1,33,10,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast been pleased with me."
01033011,1,33,11,"Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough: and he urged him, and he took it."
01033012,1,33,12,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee."
01033013,1,33,13,"And he said to him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me, and if men should over-drive them one day, all the flock will die."
01033014,1,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on slowly, according as the cattle that go before me, and the children are able to endure; until I come to my lord to Seir."
01033015,1,33,15,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the people that are with me: And he said, What needeth it? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord."
01033016,1,33,16,So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
01033017,1,33,17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
01033018,1,33,18,"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city."
01033019,1,33,19,"And he bought a part of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money."
01033020,1,33,20,"And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel."
01034001,1,34,1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
01034002,1,34,2,"And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her."
01034003,1,34,3,"And his soul cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel."
01034004,1,34,4,"And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel for a wife."
01034005,1,34,5,And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the field:) and Jacob held his peace till they had come.
01034006,1,34,6,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to commune with him.
01034007,1,34,7,"And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel, in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done."
01034008,1,34,8,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her to him for a wife."
01034009,1,34,9,"And make ye marriages with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you."
01034010,1,34,10,"And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein."
01034011,1,34,11,"And Shechem said to her father, and to her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me, I will give."
01034012,1,34,12,"Ask me never so much dower and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me: but give me the damsel for a wife."
01034013,1,34,13,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, (because he had defiled Dinah their sister,)"
01034014,1,34,14,"And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised: for that would be a reproach to us:"
01034015,1,34,15,"But in this will we consent to you: If ye will be as we are, that every male of you shall be circumcised;"
01034016,1,34,16,"Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
01034017,1,34,17,"But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone."
01034018,1,34,18,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son."
01034019,1,34,19,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father."
01034020,1,34,20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,"
01034021,1,34,21,"These men are peaceable with us, therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein: for the land, behold, it is large enough for them: let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters."
01034022,1,34,22,"Only herein, will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us shall be circumcised, as they are circumcised."
01034023,1,34,23,"Will not their cattle, and their substance, and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us."
01034024,1,34,24,"And to Hamor and to Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city: and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city."
01034025,1,34,25,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males."
01034026,1,34,26,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out."
01034027,1,34,27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city; because they had defiled their sister."
01034028,1,34,28,"They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field."
01034029,1,34,29,"And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house."
01034030,1,34,30,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites, and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they will assemble themselves against me, and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."
01034031,1,34,31,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister, as with a harlot?"
01035001,1,35,1,"And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
01035002,1,35,2,"Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:"
01035003,1,35,3,"And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
01035004,1,35,4,"And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the ear-rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem."
01035005,1,35,5,"And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
01035006,1,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (that is Beth-el) he and all the people that were with him."
01035007,1,35,7,"And he erected there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
01035008,1,35,8,"But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el, under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth."
01035009,1,35,9,And God appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram; and blessed him.
01035010,1,35,10,"And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called his name Israel."
01035011,1,35,11,"And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a multitude of nations shall spring from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins."
01035012,1,35,12,"And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
01035013,1,35,13,"And God went up from him, in the place where he talked with him."
01035014,1,35,14,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink-offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon."
01035015,1,35,15,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el."
01035016,1,35,16,"And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor."
01035017,1,35,17,"And it came to pass when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also."
01035018,1,35,18,And it came to pass as her soul was in departing (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
01035019,1,35,19,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem."
01035020,1,35,20,And Jacob set a pillar on her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
01035021,1,35,21,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar."
01035022,1,35,22,"And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:"
01035023,1,35,23,"The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:"
01035024,1,35,24,"The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:"
01035025,1,35,25,"And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:"
01035026,1,35,26,"And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Padan-aram."
01035027,1,35,27,"And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to the city of Arbah (which is Hebron) where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
01035028,1,35,28,And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.
01035029,1,35,29,"And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
01036001,1,36,1,"Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom."
01036002,1,36,2,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
01036003,1,36,3,"And Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth."
01036004,1,36,4,"And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel;"
01036005,1,36,5,"And Aholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan."
01036006,1,36,6,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he had acquired in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob."
01036007,1,36,7,"For their riches were more than that they might dwell together: and the land wherein they were strangers could not sustain them, because of their cattle."
01036008,1,36,8,Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
01036009,1,36,9,"And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites, in mount Seir:"
01036010,1,36,10,"These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau."
01036011,1,36,11,"And the sons of Eliphaz were, Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
01036012,1,36,12,And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
01036013,1,36,13,"And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife."
01036014,1,36,14,"And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon Esau's wife: and she bore to Esau, Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah."
01036015,1,36,15,"These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,"
01036016,1,36,16,"Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes, descendants of Eliphaz, in the land of Edom: these were the sons of Adah."
01036017,1,36,17,"And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes, descendants of Reuel, in the land of Edom: these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife."
01036018,1,36,18,"And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes, descendants of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah Esau's wife."
01036019,1,36,19,These are the sons of Esau (who is Edom) and these are their dukes.
01036020,1,36,20,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah."
01036021,1,36,21,"And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom."
01036022,1,36,22,"And the children of Lotan were Hori, and Heman: and Lotan's sister was Timna."
01036023,1,36,23,"And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
01036024,1,36,24,"And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah and Anah; this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father."
01036025,1,36,25,"And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah."
01036026,1,36,26,"And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran."
01036027,1,36,27,"The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Achan."
01036028,1,36,28,"The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran."
01036029,1,36,29,"These are the dukes, descendants of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,"
01036030,1,36,30,"Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan; these are the dukes, descendants of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir."
01036031,1,36,31,"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel."
01036032,1,36,32,And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
01036033,1,36,33,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead."
01036034,1,36,34,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead."
01036035,1,36,35,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad (who smote Midian in the field of Moab) reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith."
01036036,1,36,36,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead."
01036037,1,36,37,"And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead."
01036038,1,36,38,"And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead."
01036039,1,36,39,"And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab."
01036040,1,36,40,"And these are the names of the dukes, descendants of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,"
01036041,1,36,41,"Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,"
01036042,1,36,42,"Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar."
01036043,1,36,43,"Duke Magdiel, duke Iram; these are the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations, in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites."
01037001,1,37,1,"And Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
01037002,1,37,2,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought to his father their evil report."
01037003,1,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors."
01037004,1,37,4,"And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him."
01037005,1,37,5,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more."
01037006,1,37,6,"And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:"
01037007,1,37,7,"For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood around and made obeisance to my sheaf."
01037008,1,37,8,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words."
01037009,1,37,9,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more: and behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me."
01037010,1,37,10,"And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said to him, what is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"
01037011,1,37,11,And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
01037012,1,37,12,And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
01037013,1,37,13,"And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee to them. And he said to him, Here am I."
01037014,1,37,14,"And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
01037015,1,37,15,"And a certain man found him, and behold he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
01037016,1,37,16,"And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks."
01037017,1,37,17,"And the man said, They have departed hence: for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan."
01037018,1,37,18,"And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him."
01037019,1,37,19,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer is coming."
01037020,1,37,20,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit; and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
01037021,1,37,21,"And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him from their hands: and said, Let us not kill him."
01037022,1,37,22,"And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might deliver him from their hands, to bring him back to his father."
01037023,1,37,23,"And it came to pass when Joseph had come to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him."
01037024,1,37,24,"And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty; there was no water in it."
01037025,1,37,25,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery, and balm, and myrrh, going to carry them down to Egypt."
01037026,1,37,26,"And Judah said to his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood."
01037027,1,37,27,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh: and his brethren were content."
01037028,1,37,28,"Then there passed by Midianites, merchants; and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt."
01037029,1,37,29,"And Reuben returned to the pit; and behold, Joseph was not in the pit: and he rent his clothes."
01037030,1,37,30,"And he returned to his brethren, and said, The child is not: and I, whither shall I go?"
01037031,1,37,31,"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood:"
01037032,1,37,32,"And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son's coat or not."
01037033,1,37,33,"And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him: Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces."
01037034,1,37,34,"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
01037035,1,37,35,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning: Thus his father wept for him."
01037036,1,37,36,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard."
01038001,1,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
01038002,1,38,2,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in to her."
01038003,1,38,3,"And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er."
01038004,1,38,4,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan."
01038005,1,38,5,"And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him."
01038006,1,38,6,"And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, whose name was Tamar."
01038007,1,38,7,"And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him."
01038008,1,38,8,"And Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother."
01038009,1,38,9,"And Onan knew that the seed would not be his: and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he frustrated the purpose, lest he should give seed to his brother."
01038010,1,38,10,And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
01038011,1,38,11,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son shall be grown; (for he said, Lest perhaps he die also as his brethren did:) and Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house."
01038012,1,38,12,"And in process of time, the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died: and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep-shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
01038013,1,38,13,"And it was told to Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath, to shear his sheep."
01038014,1,38,14,"And she put off from her, her widow's garments, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath: for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him for a wife."
01038015,1,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face."
01038016,1,38,16,"And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me have access to thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law:) and she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayst have access to me?"
01038017,1,38,17,"And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock: and she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou sendest it?"
01038018,1,38,18,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? and she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thy hand: and he gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him."
01038019,1,38,19,"And she arose and went her way and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
01038020,1,38,20,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not."
01038021,1,38,21,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, where is the harlot that was openly by the way-side? and they said, There was no harlot in this place."
01038022,1,38,22,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place."
01038023,1,38,23,"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her."
01038024,1,38,24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold she is with child by lewdness: and Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
01038025,1,38,25,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff."
01038026,1,38,26,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son: and he knew her again no more."
01038027,1,38,27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb."
01038028,1,38,28,"And it came to pass when she travailed, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
01038029,1,38,29,"And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez."
01038030,1,38,30,And afterwards came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zarah.
01039001,1,39,1,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt: and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither."
01039002,1,39,2,"And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man: and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
01039003,1,39,3,"And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand."
01039004,1,39,4,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."
01039005,1,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake: and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house, and in the field."
01039006,1,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught he had, save the bread which he ate; and Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored."
01039007,1,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph: and she said, Lie with me."
01039008,1,39,8,"But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand:"
01039009,1,39,9,"There is none greater in his house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
01039010,1,39,10,"And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her."
01039011,1,39,11,"And it came to pass, about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within."
01039012,1,39,12,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and went out."
01039013,1,39,13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled forth,"
01039014,1,39,14,"That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us: he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
01039015,1,39,15,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and went out."
01039016,1,39,16,And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.
01039017,1,39,17,"And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought to us, came in to me to mock me."
01039018,1,39,18,"And it came to pass, as I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled."
01039019,1,39,19,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
01039020,1,39,20,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison."
01039021,1,39,21,"But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
01039022,1,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatever they did there, was done by him."
01039023,1,39,23,The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him: and that which he did the LORD made it to prosper.
01040001,1,40,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt."
01040002,1,40,2,"And Pharaoh was wroth with two of his officers, with the chief of the butlers, and with the chief of the bakers."
01040003,1,40,3,"And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound."
01040004,1,40,4,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued a season in custody."
01040005,1,40,5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream; the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison."
01040006,1,40,6,"And Joseph came to them in the morning, and looked upon them, and behold, they were sad."
01040007,1,40,7,"And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Why look ye so sad to-day?"
01040008,1,40,8,"And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you."
01040009,1,40,9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;"
01040010,1,40,10,"And on the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes:"
01040011,1,40,11,"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
01040012,1,40,12,"And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days;"
01040013,1,40,13,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler."
01040014,1,40,14,"But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness to me, I pray thee, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:"
01040015,1,40,15,For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
01040016,1,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold, I had three white baskets on my head:"
01040017,1,40,17,And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bake-meats for Pharaoh; and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.
01040018,1,40,18,"And Joseph answered, and said, This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days:"
01040019,1,40,19,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee."
01040020,1,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birth-day, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants."
01040021,1,40,21,And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
01040022,1,40,22,But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
01040023,1,40,23,"Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him."
01041001,1,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river."
01041002,1,41,2,"And behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored cows and fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow."
01041003,1,41,3,"And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed; and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river."
01041004,1,41,4,And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
01041005,1,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed the second time: and behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good."
01041006,1,41,6,"And behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them."
01041007,1,41,7,"And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream."
01041008,1,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh."
01041009,1,41,9,"Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
01041010,1,41,10,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in custody in the captain of the guard's house, both me, and the chief baker:"
01041011,1,41,11,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he: we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
01041012,1,41,12,"And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he interpreted."
01041013,1,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was: me he restored to my office, and him he hanged."
01041014,1,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came before Pharaoh."
01041015,1,41,15,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard it said of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it."
01041016,1,41,16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
01041017,1,41,17,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:"
01041018,1,41,18,"And behold, there came out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed, and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow:"
01041019,1,41,19,"And behold, seven other cows came out after them, poor, and very ill-favored, and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"
01041020,1,41,20,And the lean and the ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows:
01041021,1,41,21,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
01041022,1,41,22,"And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good:"
01041023,1,41,23,"And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:"
01041024,1,41,24,And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this to the magicians; but there was none that could explain it to me.
01041025,1,41,25,"And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one; God hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to do."
01041026,1,41,26,The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
01041027,1,41,27,And the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind will be seven years of famine.
01041028,1,41,28,This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God is about to do he showeth to Pharaoh.
01041029,1,41,29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"
01041030,1,41,30,And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
01041031,1,41,31,And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following: for it will be very grievous.
01041032,1,41,32,"And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
01041033,1,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
01041034,1,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years."
01041035,1,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh; and let them keep food in the cities."
01041036,1,41,36,"And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land may not perish through the famine."
01041037,1,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
01041038,1,41,38,"And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a man as this is, a man in whom the spirit of God is?"
01041039,1,41,39,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:"
01041040,1,41,40,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou."
01041041,1,41,41,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt."
01041042,1,41,42,"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
01041043,1,41,43,"And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had: and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt."
01041044,1,41,44,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
01041045,1,41,45,And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On: and Joseph went over all the land of Egypt.
01041046,1,41,46,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt: and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
01041047,1,41,47,And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfulls.
01041048,1,41,48,"And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field which was around every city, he laid up in the same."
01041049,1,41,49,"And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number."
01041050,1,41,50,And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came: which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.
01041051,1,41,51,"And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
01041052,1,41,52,And the name of the second called he Ephraim: for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
01041053,1,41,53,"And the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt, were ended."
01041054,1,41,54,"And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
01041055,1,41,55,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he saith to you, do."
01041056,1,41,56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt."
01041057,1,41,57,And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn; because the famine was distressing in all lands.
01042001,1,42,1,"Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
01042002,1,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: go down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die."
01042003,1,42,3,And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
01042004,1,42,4,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren: for he said, Lest perhaps mischief shall befall him."
01042005,1,42,5,And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
01042006,1,42,6,"And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the earth."
01042007,1,42,7,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them; and he said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
01042008,1,42,8,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
01042009,1,42,9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land have ye come."
01042010,1,42,10,"And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food have thy servants come."
01042011,1,42,11,We are all one man's sons; we are true men; thy servants are no spies.
01042012,1,42,12,"And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land have ye come."
01042013,1,42,13,"And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not."
01042014,1,42,14,"And Joseph said to them, That is what I spoke to you, saying, Ye are spies:"
01042015,1,42,15,"By this ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother shall come hither."
01042016,1,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there is any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies."
01042017,1,42,17,And he put them all together into custody three days.
01042018,1,42,18,"And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:"
01042019,1,42,19,"If ye are true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:"
01042020,1,42,20,"But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so."
01042021,1,42,21,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us."
01042022,1,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the young man; and ye would not hear? therefore behold also his blood is required."
01042023,1,42,23,And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke to them by an interpreter.
01042024,1,42,24,"And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes."
01042025,1,42,25,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them."
01042026,1,42,26,"And they loaded their asses with the corn, and departed thence."
01042027,1,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money: for behold, it was in his sack's mouth."
01042028,1,42,28,"And he said to his brethren, My money is restored; and see it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done to us?"
01042029,1,42,29,"And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell them, saying,"
01042030,1,42,30,"The man who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
01042031,1,42,31,"And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies:"
01042032,1,42,32,"We are twelve brethren, sons of our father: one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
01042033,1,42,33,"And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, By this shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and depart:"
01042034,1,42,34,"And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: then will I deliver to you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land."
01042035,1,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid."
01042036,1,42,36,"And Jacob their father said to them, Me have ye bereaved: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me."
01042037,1,42,37,"And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again."
01042038,1,42,38,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief shall befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
01042039,1,42,39,\43:1\And the famine was severe in the land.
01043001,1,43,1,"\43:2\And it came to pass, when they had consumed the corn which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food."
01043002,1,43,2,"\43:3\And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
01043003,1,43,3,"\43:4\If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:"
01043004,1,43,4,"\43:5\But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
01043005,1,43,5,"\43:6\And Israel said, Why dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?"
01043006,1,43,6,"\43:7\And they said, The man asked us strictly concerning our state, and our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: Could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
01043007,1,43,7,"\43:8\And Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones."
01043008,1,43,8,"\43:9\I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:"
01043009,1,43,9,"\43:10\For except we had delayed, surely now we had returned this second time."
01043010,1,43,10,"\43:11\And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:"
01043011,1,43,11,"\43:12\And take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; it may be it was an oversight:"
01043012,1,43,12,"\43:13\Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man:"
01043013,1,43,13,"\43:14\And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin: If I be bereaved, I am bereaved."
01043014,1,43,14,"\43:15\And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and arose, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
01043015,1,43,15,"\43:16\And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready: for these men shall dine with me at noon."
01043016,1,43,16,\43:17\And the man did as Joseph commanded: and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
01043017,1,43,17,"\43:18\And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bond-men, and our asses."
01043018,1,43,18,"\43:19\And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,"
01043019,1,43,19,"\43:20\And said, O sir, we came down indeed at the first time to buy food:"
01043020,1,43,20,"\43:21\And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
01043021,1,43,21,\43:22\And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
01043022,1,43,22,"\43:23\And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them."
01043023,1,43,23,"\43:24\And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender."
01043024,1,43,24,\43:25\And they made ready the present against Joseph should come at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
01043025,1,43,25,"\43:26\And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."
01043026,1,43,26,"\43:27\And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?"
01043027,1,43,27,"\43:28\And they answered, Thy servant, our father, is in good health, he is yet alive: and they bowed their heads and made obeisance."
01043028,1,43,28,"\43:29\And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son."
01043029,1,43,29,"\43:30\And Joseph made haste; for his bowels yearned towards his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there."
01043030,1,43,30,"\43:31\And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread."
01043031,1,43,31,"\43:32\And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians."
01043032,1,43,32,"\43:33\And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birth-right, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men wondered one at another."
01043033,1,43,33,"\43:34\And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him."
01044001,1,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth."
01044002,1,44,2,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money: and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
01044003,1,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they, and their asses."
01044004,1,44,4,"And when they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?"
01044005,1,44,5,"Is not this the cup in which my lord drinketh, and by which indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing."
01044006,1,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words."
01044007,1,44,7,"And they said to him, Why saith my lord these words? Far be it from us that thy servants should do according to this thing:"
01044008,1,44,8,"Behold, the money which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to thee from the land of Canaan: how then should we steal from thy lord's house silver or gold?"
01044009,1,44,9,"With whom soever of thy servants it shall be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bond-men."
01044010,1,44,10,"And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it shall be found, shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless."
01044011,1,44,11,"Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
01044012,1,44,12,"And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
01044013,1,44,13,"Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city."
01044014,1,44,14,"And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, (for he was yet there:) and they fell before him on the ground."
01044015,1,44,15,"And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?"
01044016,1,44,16,"And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found."
01044017,1,44,17,"And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go in peace to your father."
01044018,1,44,18,"Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh."
01044019,1,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
01044020,1,44,20,"And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him."
01044021,1,44,21,"And thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him."
01044022,1,44,22,"And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die."
01044023,1,44,23,"And thou saidst to thy servants, Except your youngest brother shall come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
01044024,1,44,24,"And it came to pass, when we came to thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord."
01044025,1,44,25,"And our father said, Go again; buy us a little food."
01044026,1,44,26,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother shall be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother shall be with us."
01044027,1,44,27,"And thy servant my father, said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons:"
01044028,1,44,28,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:"
01044029,1,44,29,"And if ye take this also from me, and mischief shall befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
01044030,1,44,30,"Now therefore, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; (seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life)"
01044031,1,44,31,"It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father, with sorrow to the grave."
01044032,1,44,32,"For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I will bear the blame to my father for ever."
01044033,1,44,33,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bond-man to my lord; and let the lad return with his brethren."
01044034,1,44,34,"For how shall I return to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father."
01045001,1,45,1,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me: and there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brethren."
01045002,1,45,2,And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
01045003,1,45,3,"And Joseph said to his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence."
01045004,1,45,4,"And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you: and they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt."
01045005,1,45,5,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for God sent me before you to preserve life."
01045006,1,45,6,"For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in which there shall neither be tillage nor harvest."
01045007,1,45,7,"And God sent me before you, to preserve for you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
01045008,1,45,8,"So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt."
01045009,1,45,9,"Haste ye, and return to my father, and say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me; delay not:"
01045010,1,45,10,"And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:"
01045011,1,45,11,"And there will I nourish thee, (for yet there are five years of famine,) lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, should come to poverty."
01045012,1,45,12,"And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh to you."
01045013,1,45,13,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste, and bring down my father hither."
01045014,1,45,14,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck."
01045015,1,45,15,"Moreover, he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him."
01045016,1,45,16,"And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
01045017,1,45,17,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, return to the land of Canaan;"
01045018,1,45,18,"And take your father, and your households, and come to me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land."
01045019,1,45,19,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
01045020,1,45,20,Also regard not your furniture; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
01045021,1,45,21,"And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
01045022,1,45,22,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment."
01045023,1,45,23,"And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and meat, for his father by the way."
01045024,1,45,24,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that ye contend not by the way."
01045025,1,45,25,"And they went up from Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father,"
01045026,1,45,26,"And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not."
01045027,1,45,27,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:"
01045028,1,45,28,"And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die."
01046001,1,46,1,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac."
01046002,1,46,2,"And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob: and he said, Here am I."
01046003,1,46,3,"And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:"
01046004,1,46,4,I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
01046005,1,46,5,"And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
01046006,1,46,6,"And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:"
01046007,1,46,7,"His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt."
01046008,1,46,8,"And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born."
01046009,1,46,9,"And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi."
01046010,1,46,10,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman."
01046011,1,46,11,"And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
01046012,1,46,12,"And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron, and Hamul."
01046013,1,46,13,"And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron."
01046014,1,46,14,"And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel."
01046015,1,46,15,"These are the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three."
01046016,1,46,16,"And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggai, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli."
01046017,1,46,17,"And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel."
01046018,1,46,18,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter: and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls."
01046019,1,46,19,"The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin."
01046020,1,46,20,"And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him."
01046021,1,46,21,"And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard."
01046022,1,46,22,"These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the souls were fourteen."
01046023,1,46,23,And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
01046024,1,46,24,"And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem."
01046025,1,46,25,"These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob: all the souls were seven."
01046026,1,46,26,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were sixty and six."
01046027,1,46,27,"And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy."
01046028,1,46,28,"And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct his face to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen."
01046029,1,46,29,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went to meet Israel his father to Goshen; and presented himself to him: and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
01046030,1,46,30,"And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive."
01046031,1,46,31,"And Joseph said to his brethren, and to his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan are come to me."
01046032,1,46,32,"And the men are shepherds, for their employment hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have."
01046033,1,46,33,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?"
01046034,1,46,34,"That ye shall say, The occupation of thy servants hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."
01047001,1,47,1,"Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
01047002,1,47,2,"And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them to Pharaoh."
01047003,1,47,3,"And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers."
01047004,1,47,4,"They said moreover to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land: for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
01047005,1,47,5,"And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren have come to thee:"
01047006,1,47,6,"The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle."
01047007,1,47,7,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
01047008,1,47,8,"And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old art thou?"
01047009,1,47,9,"And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, nor have they attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage."
01047010,1,47,10,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh."
01047011,1,47,11,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
01047012,1,47,12,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread according to their families."
01047013,1,47,13,"And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very distressing, so that the land of Egypt, and all the land of Canaan, fainted by reason of the famine."
01047014,1,47,14,"And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house."
01047015,1,47,15,"And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence: for the money faileth."
01047016,1,47,16,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money hath failed."
01047017,1,47,17,"And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread, for all their cattle, for that year."
01047018,1,47,18,"When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not aught left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands:"
01047019,1,47,19,"Why shall we die before thy eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate."
01047020,1,47,20,"And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's."
01047021,1,47,21,"And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof."
01047022,1,47,22,"Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them by Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands."
01047023,1,47,23,"Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land."
01047024,1,47,24,"And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
01047025,1,47,25,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
01047026,1,47,26,"And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's."
01047027,1,47,27,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions in it and grew, and multiplied exceedingly."
01047028,1,47,28,And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred and forty seven years.
01047029,1,47,29,"And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:"
01047030,1,47,30,"But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said."
01047031,1,47,31,"And he said, Swear to me: and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head."
01048001,1,48,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
01048002,1,48,2,"And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh to thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed."
01048003,1,48,3,"And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
01048004,1,48,4,"And said to me, Behold I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee, for an everlasting possession."
01048005,1,48,5,"And now, thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine."
01048006,1,48,6,"And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance."
01048007,1,48,7,"And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, the same is Beth-lehem."
01048008,1,48,8,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?"
01048009,1,48,9,"And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, and I will bless them."
01048010,1,48,10,"(Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see:) And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
01048011,1,48,11,"And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed."
01048012,1,48,12,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
01048013,1,48,13,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand towards Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him."
01048014,1,48,14,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands by design; for Manasseh was the first-born."
01048015,1,48,15,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long to this day,"
01048016,1,48,16,"The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac: and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
01048017,1,48,17,"And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he lifted his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head."
01048018,1,48,18,"And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head."
01048019,1,48,19,"And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations."
01048020,1,48,20,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
01048021,1,48,21,"And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers."
01048022,1,48,22,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
01049001,1,49,1,"And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Assemble yourselves, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days."
01049002,1,49,2,"Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob: and hearken to Israel your father."
01049003,1,49,3,"Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellence of dignity, and the excellence of power:"
01049004,1,49,4,"Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it; he went up to my couch."
01049005,1,49,5,"Simeon and Levi are brethren: instruments of cruelty are in, their habitations."
01049006,1,49,6,"O my soul, come not thou into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall."
01049007,1,49,7,"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce: and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel."
01049008,1,49,8,"Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise; thy hand shall be on the neck of thy enemies: thy father's children shall bow down before thee."
01049009,1,49,9,"Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou hast gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion: who shall rouse him up?"
01049010,1,49,10,"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh shall come: and to him shall be the gathering of the people."
01049011,1,49,11,"Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:"
01049012,1,49,12,"His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk."
01049013,1,49,13,Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be to Zidon.
01049014,1,49,14,"Issachar is a strong ass, couching down between two burdens:"
01049015,1,49,15,"And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute."
01049016,1,49,16,"Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel."
01049017,1,49,17,"Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backward."
01049018,1,49,18,I have waited for thy salvation O LORD.
01049019,1,49,19,"Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last."
01049020,1,49,20,"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties."
01049021,1,49,21,Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
01049022,1,49,22,"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:"
01049023,1,49,23,"The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:"
01049024,1,49,24,"But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob: from thence is the shepherd the stone of Israel:"
01049025,1,49,25,"Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:"
01049026,1,49,26,"The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren."
01049027,1,49,27,"Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil."
01049028,1,49,28,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it which their father spoke to them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them."
01049029,1,49,29,"And he charged them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite."
01049030,1,49,30,"In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place."
01049031,1,49,31,"(There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah,)"
01049032,1,49,32,"The purchase of the field and of the cave that is in it, was from the children of Heth."
01049033,1,49,33,"And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his people."
01050001,1,50,1,"And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him."
01050002,1,50,2,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
01050003,1,50,3,And forty days were fulfilled for him; (for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed:) and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
01050004,1,50,4,"And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
01050005,1,50,5,"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again."
01050006,1,50,6,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear."
01050007,1,50,7,"And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
01050008,1,50,8,"And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen."
01050009,1,50,9,And there went with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
01050010,1,50,10,"And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days."
01050011,1,50,11,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan."
01050012,1,50,12,And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:
01050013,1,50,13,"For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre."
01050014,1,50,14,"And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father."
01050015,1,50,15,"And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him."
01050016,1,50,16,"And they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,"
01050017,1,50,17,"So shall ye say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did to thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him."
01050018,1,50,18,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face: and they said, Behold, we are thy servants."
01050019,1,50,19,"And Joseph said to them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?"
01050020,1,50,20,"But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive."
01050021,1,50,21,"Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them."
01050022,1,50,22,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years."
01050023,1,50,23,"And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph's knees."
01050024,1,50,24,"And Joseph said to his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
01050025,1,50,25,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence."
01050026,1,50,26,"So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
